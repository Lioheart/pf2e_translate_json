Unlike their selfish superiors, aapophs are communal and group together to hunt, wrestle, and sleep curled together in pits. Though they're looked down upon and insulted by zyss, most aapophs lack the higher brain functions to recognize when they're being insulted, much less plan or execute a rebellion. Aapophs often have unusual physical mutations-horns, vestigial tails, or spines protruding from their scales-yet these variations have little impact on their overall combat prowess- and combat prowess is the measure by which zyss judge them.</p>",

A clever and stealthy hunter, the ahuizotl lures unwary prey to their doom by mimicking the cries of people in distress. The ahuizotl's macabre habit of feeding on a victim's eyes, fingernails, and teeth leaves the corpses of its kills uniquely mutilated. Some say the creatures consider these body parts delicacies, while others insist ahuizotls collect them as tribute to a powerful but unknown entity. The fact that an ahuizotl does not eat the actual flesh of its victims, instead depositing their savaged and waterlogged corpses in locations where the remains are sure to be found by friends or family, points to a third and perhaps more likely possibility-the ahuizotl simply enjoys using its violent dietary quirks to spread fear and despair.</p>\n<p>An ahuizotl walks on all fours, but its hands are capable of manipulating simple tools and other objects. Ahuizotls have roughly mustelid features and an extra membrane covering their eyes, giving their eyes a dull color suggestive of cataracts and somewhat blunting the creature's vision. Yet despite their bestial appearance, ahuizotls are nearly as intelligent as the average human, and wiser than most. Although they don't form societies of their own, they have been known to ally with violent cults or conclaves of monsters, and even to found small shrines and temples to sinister deities. The cult of Charon, the horseman of Death, is particularly popular among certain ahuizotls, who look forward to an afterlife spent wallowing in the waters of the River Styx.</p>"

These cocoons allow the creatures to travel through the void of space, seeking new worlds where they can infect suitable humanoid hosts with their larval young. Once a victim succumbs to this infection, the offspring fight among themselves until one proves the strongest.

In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers flee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together, they merge into a horrific form as an animate dream.</p>\n<p>Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these forms, animate dreams find their way out of the Dreamlands and into the waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.</p>\n<p>An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link to that individual's dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the victim finds it more and more difficult to remain awake. In the end, the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form of fear and are its preferred sustenance.</p>\n<p>An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular nightmares, but these lesser fears aren't as satisfying, often driving the animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an animate dream won't starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a specific nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.</p>",

Once the plant has killed a creature, it pulls the carcass over to its roots to feed from the decaying flesh. Although an assassin vine lacks eyes, it can detect and track prey through a combination of using its root systems to detect vibrations through topsoil and its leaves to detect heat changes in the vicinity. Although the assassin vine has no real intelligence, its learned behaviors mimic those of cunning ambush hunters.</p>\n<p>As it is slow moving, the assassin vine typically remains rooted in a single area for as long as it has sufficient prey. Though most often found along woodland trails or swamps, these plants can also be encountered in more rural settlements, poorly tended fields, and vineyards. While assassin vines can't be trained in the classical sense, they can be used as defenses, and woodland-dwelling creatures like goblins and fey have been known to cultivate assassin vines as guardians for less-used routes into their lairs. In such cases, the tenders often seek to make the path more obvious than its disuse would otherwise suggest, while simultaneously working to ensure the bones of the vines' victims are removed to keep their presence a secret, resulting in what appears to be an easy approach to the den but is actually an organic ambush.</p>\n<p>Mature assassin vines grow to 20 feet long and have smaller vines extending off the main trunk that reach from to 5 to 10 feet in length. The smallest of these vines sprout every 6 inches or so; they tend to grow clusters of full leaves and occasionally bear small berries.

When they encounter creatures their own size or larger they retreat, flashing their eyes to facilitate their escape if necessary. They often hunt in pairs or small packs. Using their lights to coordinate from a distance, they slowly close in on the creatures they hunt.

These honorable creatures are as intelligent as most humanoids. They live and hunt in large packs, roaming forests, plains, and the hidden places of the world in hunt for evil creatures-particularly those that dwell in the depths of the Ethereal Plane.</p>\n<p>Unless acting in concert with specific allies who have proven that their goals are shared, blink dogs tend to avoid other creatures if at all possible. Their packs are constantly on the move and hidden from those that would seek them out. But in times of need, they have been known to come to the rescue of villages and lost travelers. While they have no innate ability to travel to the Ethereal Plane for extended periods of time, all blink dogs constantly shimmer and ripple between the Material Plane and the Ethereal. They do their best to use their ability to blink to snatch glimpses into the Ethereal Plane and keep track of potential threats that might be building there, but in practice this tactic yields more of a constant stream of hunches and estimations of Ethereal-based threats. Of course, to a blink dog, this constant state of flux is as natural as breathing.</p>\n<p>Pack leadership always falls to a pair-an elder blink dog (called an alpha) who relies upon the valued guidance of a trusted pack mate (the sage). Honor and tradition are keystones of blink dog society. They are fiercely loyal, defending the pack or creatures they befriend to the death and maintaining oaths handed down from litter to litter. Though different packs hold different traditions and oaths, their connection through the tales and stories told among their kind and the shared experience of the movement of stars above weave all blink dogs into an extended family, a great pack. Through their myths and folklore, blink dogs have names for celestial phenomena, note births under auspicious stars, and read omens from unusual stellar conjunctions. These celestial signs are woven into blink dogs' lifeways; their names contain a reference to the specific constellation under which they were born, and a pack's sage watches the heavens for signs to help them decide when a pup is old enough for their first hunt.</p>"

Their limbs are lithe and willowy, and their eyes are generally solid yellow, yellow-green, or white, though a rare few have a purple or blue glow.</p>\n<p>Fetchlings have developed their own complex societies in the Shadow Plane, often under the tolerance of or in servitude to the strange, malignant creatures there, such as the sinister velstracs or the enigmatic d'ziriaks. While individual fetchlings can be any alignment, they are all survivors in a harsh environment, which leads to a tendency toward pragmatism. Fetchling clothing mimics the regions they dwell in, with drab colors tending toward darker shades. When they trade with humans or other societies on the Material Plane, they often wear masks or concealing clothing to hide their appearance.</p>\n<p>Typical fetchling communities are insular and swiftly close ranks in the event of an intruder. Though individual fetchlings don't mind traveling to and blending in with other societies to facilitate trade, they often hide or even react defensively if they have their own visitors. When one considers the nature of the other denizens of the Shadow Plane, however, this tendency to assume the worst of interlopers might make sense to some.</p>\n<p>Fetchlings are not as common on the Material Plane; most of those who dwell there are loners by choice who have left their home to seek out adventure elsewhere, exiles who were banished from their homelands, or planar castaways with no ability to return to the Shadow Plane. This last category, the lost and stranded, are the most likely to be found in larger groups. In cities of significant size, one can sometimes even find a small community of a few dozen or more fetchlings living among humans, although they often do so subtly by dyeing their hair, wearing brightly colored clothing, and utilizing layers of makeup to hide their pallid complexions.</p>"

Farmers and ranchers, especially those living near swamps known to contain giant slugs, keep close tabs on these journeys. Many almanacs go into great detail on slug migration and mating seasons. Since each giant slug needs its own wide hunting ground, the creatures typically come into proximity to mate only once a year.

This boldness serves as a reminder that nature can be cruel, capricious, and owes no debt to humanity. Grimstalkers are happy to perform nature's dirty work and particularly enjoy targeting loggers, hunters, and explorers, regardless of whether they respect the natural setting they work or travel within.</p>\n<p>Grimstalkers are gaunt and hairless, and their mottled, green and brown flesh gives them the appearance of moss-draped bark. When damaged, they bleed a thick, sap-like blood. They mark their territories by lopping off the heads of their victims and stringing them up in the surrounding trees, a practice that often lures dangerous scavengers into their lands. Carnivorous and thorny plants are often found in wilds where grimstalkers dwell, filling roles that pets might in human society, though grimstalkers tend to treat these \"pets\" poorly at best.</p>\n<p>There are few accounts of grimstalkers working with other fey-for the most part, grimstalkers see their kin from the First World as cowards or weaklings, or perhaps both. Even notoriously violent fey such as redcaps shy from them, as grimstalkers consider their own kind the only company worth keeping.</p>\n<p>Grimstalkers hunt in small bands, using stealth to approach their targets. They surround enemies first, then work to unnerve them by knocking on trees or howling out threats in Aklo to distract and panic their quarry. Of course, a band of grimstalkers won't stay together for long, quickly succumbing to bickering and infighting. These violent arguments are common pastimes among grimstalkers, often ending with each grimstalker going its own way. Not even the presence of more powerful fey or commanding creatures can keep grimstalkers from their predisposed bickering. Some scholars theorize that this quality speaks to an ancient curse that once afflicted fey who were judged too cantankerous, but in truth, it's just part of what makes a grimstalker what it is: ill-tempered, confrontational, and bitter.</p>",

Grindylows generally organize into schools ranging from a few individuals to a few hundred.

They often lair in mobile shelters, such as a sargasso of seaweed or the hull of an abandoned ship. They are skilled scavengers and hunters that eat anything they can sink their teeth into.</p>\n<p>Grindylows respect the power of bigger sea predators but have a special hatred for squids (or anything they believe looks like a squid). Sailors plying grindylow-infested waters often paint the images of squids on the bottoms of their hulls in hopes of warding the little terrors off. While this can keep smaller schools at bay, it can also backfire, potentially inciting larger groups to gather for a coordinated attack; this becomes especially more likely if the ship's route becomes predictable.

The jabberwock hails from the fey realm of the First World and is part of a group of powerful First World creatures known collectively as the Tane.</p>\n<p>Like all members of the Tane, jabberwocks are living creatures that age, eat, drink, and sleep, but do not reproduce normally. Instead, they are created directly by the godlike Eldest who rule the First World, and they serve at the pleasure of these capricious and mysterious entities. Believed to be the most powerful of all the Tane, jabberwocks are typically only ever created with one purpose: to wreak destruction and havoc upon the Material Plane. One of the Eldest might send a jabberwock to devastate a country, continent, or even entire world in order to get revenge for some slight made against them by a single mortal. Sometimes, no specific insult or injury is required, as some of the Eldest resent the very existence of the Material Plane and periodically create jabberwocks simply to express the wrath of the First World against its younger and less chaotic sibling.</p>\n<p>Once a jabberwock arrives on the Material Plane, its first order of business is to seek out a lair. It prefers dwelling in remote forest locations about a day's flight from civilization-the more dangerous the woodland is to those who might eventually come hunting it, the better!</p>\n<p>The relationship between jabberwocks and vorpal weapons is the subject of much debate and speculation among scholars, and the various poems, songs, and legends about the jabberwock do little to clarify the issue, conflicting and diverging on this point. Some believe that vorpal weapons were first created specifically to combat jabberwocks, but others take the story one step further. They cite evidence in certain ancient myths that there may once have been only a single, unique jabberwock, so powerful that nothing could so much as scratch it-nothing, that is, except for the first vorpal sword, crafted for that very purpose. So epic was the resulting battle that it created strange echoes throughout reality, and as a result, these echoes, in the form of vorpal weapons, can now be found on many worlds. Those who subscribe to this belief claim that the jabberwocks seen today are but pale imitations of this proto-jabberwock, and they speculate that only the combined efforts of several Eldest would be sufficient to create such a creature again.</p>\n<p>Variant JabberwocksThe Eldest have sometimes altered certain aspects of the jabberwocks they create. Some of the more notorious or legendary variant jabberwocks include the following.</p>\n<p>Frumious Jabberwock: Frumious jabberwocks have two heads. They are level 24 and gain an extra action on each of their turns they can use only to make a jaws Strike.</p>\n<p>Mimsy Jabberwock: Typically hailing from wintry regions of the First World, mimsy jabberwocks have glowing blue-white scales, resist cold instead of fire, and have eyes that burn with blue flames that deal cold damage instead of fire damage.</p>\n<p>Slithy Jabberwock: Wreaking destruction beneath the waves, these sinuous and slimy jabberwocks are amphibious, have a swim Speed of 80 feet instead of the normal fly Speed, and do not have a wing Strike. A slithy jabberwock's whiffling aura is activated whenever it swims, makes a tail Strike, or Burbles.</p>",

On the other hand, if someone approaches a nixie with respect, or even better, a positive attitude that displays just the right amount of humility and easygoing openness, a nixie is far more likely to respond positively to any requests for aid. Often a nixie will ask those who seek their assistance to perform a task for them first; such requests can be minor acts of entertainment (such as telling a rousing story or performing a requested song), but in other cases the nixie might need more significant aid, such as driving off an unwanted local predator or investigating the source of pollution near their home.</p>\n<p>Nixies resort to violence only if no other tactic works. They much prefer solutions that rely upon primal magic to defuse conflicts before they can escalate to bloodshed. In pursuit of such resolutions, nixies rely on their ability to charm individuals and, when they can establish magical influence, encourage intruders to leave peacefully. While some nixies try to confuse intruders and subtly guide them from the area, others use local animals and beasts to scare off trespassers. Occasionally, nixies recruit charmed humanoids to act as protectors or help with a task that is simply too big for them to deal with.

Magdh claims to be watching the threads of fate for some ominous prophesied cataclysm, and in addition to assisting in her divinations, Magdh expects the norns who serve her to follow her cryptic commands to help nudge the future away from the brink. However, norns are powerful beings in their own right, themselves capable of granting divine power, and many balk at serving the enigmatic demigod.

Twigjacks go out of their way to ingratiate themselves to the fey creatures they live among.

Water yai pursue the acquisition of material wealth and riches above all other interests, garbing themselves in richly colored, magically waterproofed kimonos and adorning their monstrous faces with all manner of jewelry. These yai can infuse their kimonos with eerie magical properties, and in combat, they can also fire bolts of electricity from their third eye.</p>",

The benefit is always short-lived, however. When umbral dragons exhaust their preferred prey, they turn on whatever living creatures happen to be nearby. Umbral dragons sometimes go to great lengths to obtain their favorite meals, even creating undead creatures that they then feast upon.</p>\n<p>For all their power, umbral dragons are uninterested in fair battles. When faced with foes that pose any kind of actual danger to them, umbral dragons flee into the shadows and seek to strike back through pawns or minions rather than risk their own lives. Their treasure hoards are varied and diverse, often augmented by loot stolen from crypts the dragons have turned into feeding grounds. They have a strong respect for and interest in traditions and heirlooms, and they often seek to augment their hoards with items of great value that have been handed down through the generations of those whose corpses and ghosts they've fed upon.</p>"

            "publicNotes": "<p>Zebubs serve as Hell's messengers and spies. Their ability to share what they've seen with other creatures makes them especially useful-not only to other devils, but also to mortal conjurers. Some infernal lords unleash them in enormous, horrid swarms upon unsuspecting lands to debase flesh and land alike while collecting secrets the infernal host might later put to use. Zebubs use any opportunity to manipulate weak-willed or easily tempted mortals into serving the zebubs' whims. While arrogant and deceitful, zebubs lack the cunning and confidence of most devils, and thus their schemes often focus on satisfying self-serving or self-destructive ambitions. Zebubs form from the souls of childish and craven mortals, reshaped by the archdevil Baalzebul in the frozen, filthy wastes of Hell's seventh layer, Cocytus.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Each type of devil plays a particular role in Hell's bureaucracies and hierarchies, though some have far more specialized functions than others.</p>",

Instead of hands, the zelekhut's arms end in long, barbed chains that crackle with electricity. Whether sent by the powers of Axis or summoned by mortal authorities, the zelekhut seeks out those who continually evade justice-either through active flight, or by abusing their power and station-so as to bring justice to the multiverse's most notorious fugitives and criminals. Indeed, many a zelekhut's quarry are as famous for their ability to evade capture as for the crimes they commit.</p>\n<p>Though the zelekhut is implacable and unrelenting in enforcing sentences, it does not pass judgments of its own or take the initiative in pursuing targets of opportunity. While hunting a condemned serial killer or notorious thief across half a dozen planes, the zelekhut wouldn't shift a single hoof to capture a corrupt ruler whose offenses are far greater. All zelekhuts understand that laws can and must differ from place to place, and it is not the zelekhut's job to moralize, merely to obey its rightful assignments and track down those who seek to flee their punishment.</p>",
