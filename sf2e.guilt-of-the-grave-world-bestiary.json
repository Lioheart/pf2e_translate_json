Faceless are often drawn to carved or painted faces and sometimes attack other undead creatures.</p>\n<p>The Corpse Fleet recruits faceless undead to use as shock troops during boarding maneuvers.

Some theologians and scientists believe they're the husk left over after an undead creature's personality breaks down. Faceless don't recall their own origins, and their personalities grow more unstable every time they steal a new face.

These gefs were extremely valuable and became popular pets among the upper echelon of elebrians sages, who claimed their pets also had magical properties.</p>\n<p>When elite elebrians sought refuge from the escalating sarcesian conflict, they brought their beloved gefs with them. A few gefs survived in underground bunkers, but living pets fell out of favor once the majority of Eoxians made the transition to undeath. The last living gefs were pampered by their owners for the remainders of their natural lives, allowed a peaceful death, and immediately reanimated as undead creatures to continue providing eternal companionship.</p>\n<p>Phantom gefs are reanimated pets or service animals brought back to unlife by their owners. Most phantom gefs behave similarly to how they did in life. Domesticated gefs retain their training and prefer the company of creatures they bonded with in life.

The crew was forced to land on a nearby planet in order to repair their ship and gather the intel necessary to navigate the system.</p>\n<p>Always looking for an angle, the loyal camera crew followed up-and-coming producer Reculo (ambitious male elebrian producer) into the wilderness to document their experiences. Before the producer was swallowed whole, he managed to capture footage of a curious creature\u2014large, flat, and shaped like a mound of dirt and moss with rows of razor-sharp teeth.</p>\n<p>A breeding pair of these ferocious creatures managed to sneak into the ship's cargo hull before the crew departed, or perhaps someone smuggled a specimen aboard to sell back home\u2014nobody knows. The transplanted beasts infested Pact Port's hangars, where they wormed their way onto ships bound for other Pact Worlds.</p>\n<p>The undead of Eox have made the most of their reculobutapus infestation. Once they realized the creatures can be pacified with low jolts of electricity and frequent meals of fresh meat, some necrovites sought after these stylish creatures as pets, prizing them for their ability to change color to match an owner's outfit or home decor\u2014better yet, they provide an extra level of home defense if they aren't fed frequently.</p><h2>Reculobutapus Companions</h2><p>Most consider it dangerous to keep monsters as pets, but a few reckless collectors or nature enthusiasts do it anyway. It's difficult to tame and care for a reculobutapus, which weighs up to 2,100 pounds and needs 20 pounds of fresh meat per day to stay healthy. Hungry reculobutapuses regress quickly, forget their training, and carelessly devour their caregivers. However, undead creatures don't make good meals and can usually heal from a reculobutapus mauling, making the prospect of owning such a dangerous creature less daunting.</p><h2>Designer Pets of the Future?</h2><p>Zo! adopted a litter of reculobutapuses brought in as props for a production.

Rigor mortics are ammunition and shock trooper combined, designed to blast through hulls or crash-land into planets\u2014and keep fighting without falling apart on impact.</p><h2>Forging a Rigor Mortic</h2><p>Rigor mortics are built from chunks of soldiers left behind on the battlefield, grafted into heavy armor and reanimated by necromagitech. Some rigor mortics are forged from the corpses of Corpse Fleet heroes whose bodies are too broken to continue fighting, but most are amalgams of Corpse Fleet survivors, dead enemies, and living conscripts cruelly forced to endure this fate. Once a collection of parts is grafted permanently into a suit of armor, the final step is coating the rigor mortic in a shell of supernatural ice, turning them into projectiles that can be fired from starship cannons in squads of two to four per shot. These \"rigor mortars,\" as they've been nicknamed by some fleet captains, are stored in cryohangars until the moment they're loaded into a cannon. The ice melts away during the rigor mortic's flight, releasing the thawed undead from their shell.</p>",

Though its current necrovite rulers don't care to record the myriad of lifeforms that once flourished there, Eox once hosted countless species of wildlife. Most of these creatures died in the cataclysm that ruined the planet, but some have managed to make the transition to undeath in the time since.</p>\n<p>Xoalats were once the most popular livestock animals on the continent of Atraskia. Vast ranches farmed these animals in a coastal plains region now known as the Atraskian Shelf. With a single horn and sturdy frame, mature xoalat hides grew into thick braids of hair in many colors that ranchers would harvest for textiles. Xoalats thrive in most environments from arid plains to arctic tundra and consume less feed than typical livestock, as they spend their time rooting in the ground for bugs, weeds, and roots.</p>\n<p>Every living xoalat perished after the Death Wail rebounded at Eox, but some returned as undead creatures afterward, either woken by undead ranchers or reanimated by ambient necromantic processes. Today, all remaining xoalats are undead, and only a few elebrians own rare items woven from xoalat mane that were passed down through their families for many generations. Rarely, elebrians have allowed these precious heirlooms to be examined by scientists, giving the galaxy the first glimpse of the beauty of xoalat mane textiles in centuries.</p>\n<p>Xoalats have adapted to the strange necrotic ecosystem that has taken over the Eoxian wilderness. Scientists and sages are baffled by the resurgence of unlife outside the necropolises, where bone sages have carefully cultivate undead ecologies controlled by magic. Only a few secretive Xenowardens have managed to study these blighted environments.</p>\n<p>As herd animals, xoalats are usually docile, but they can be spooked by the presence of living creatures. When panicked, a xoalat tries to escape to open ground but violently lashes out at anyone or anything in their path to safety.</p><h2>Xoalat Husbandry</h2><p>Undead xoalats have developed the ability to slowly regenerate their bones, marrow, and leathery hides. Instead of cloth and textiles, modern xoalat ranchers harvest samples of bone marrow and hide from their regenerating herds. These materials are valuable to necrograft manufacturers and medical technology companies all over Eox.</p><h2>Xoalat Behavior</h2><p>Xenowardens who have studied these pitiful creatures are fascinated by their behavior, which seems to consist of repetitive loops that mimic the activities of living xoalats. Frequently observed behaviors include rooting around in the dead Eoxian soil even though they don't need to eat, grazing and roaming in herds, and making a loud mewling sound. Xoalats are generally timid unless spooked, but respond well to undead ranchers.</p>",
