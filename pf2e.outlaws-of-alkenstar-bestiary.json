A medusa may seek out powerful magic items, use divination magic to discover secret knowledge and unlock forbidden power, or infiltrate a society to beguile influential politicians. Their ability to worm their way into powerful organizations makes them natural leaders of criminal outfits and thieves' guilds, and their interest in magical phenomena leads some to pursue careers as oracles who offer to help adventurers find what they seek-for a price. Of course, if wit and deception proves insufficient, a medusa can always simply turn rivals into ornate stone decorations with little more than a glare.</p>\n<p>Exceptionally agile and surprisingly hardy, a medusa rarely backs down from a conflict even when cornered. Many adventurers who thought themselves readied to resist the effects of a medusa's gaze have nevertheless fallen to a medusa, as these creatures are also often deadly archers able to riddle their foes with venom-coated arrows from a distance. Still, a medusa may barter for their life if no alternatives remain, and the secrets carried by these powerful villains often make it more than worth sparing the monster's life.</p>",

In addition, these dangerous plants are expert climbers, making their pursuit even more difficult to escape from.</p>\n<p>A hungry dezullon keeps prey off-balance by spilling its putrid, psychoactive digestive juices from its central pitcher. In addition to being highly acidic, the enzymes in a dezullon's digestive tract, once expelled, inflict a victim with powerful hallucinations and amnesia. This secondary effect makes dezullons highly sought after in some circles, including avid drug users, experimental doctors, and criminals who deal in poisons.</p>\n<p>Many varieties of dezullon exist, including lumbering giants of incredible size, those that have tiny, cup-shaped pitchers that proliferate along lengths of creeping ivy like suckers on a squid's tentacles, and others with hundreds of blood-red, razor-sharp leaves that protrude from the inside of their pitchers like a leech's teeth.

Most creatures on the Astral Plane are visitors-predators seeking to poach from the River of Souls, psychopomps guarding against such incursions, and aeons monitoring the flow of raw quintessence through the Antipode. Yet, this plane has spawned creatures native to its strange currents and eddies, foremost of which is the family of thought-spawned creatures known as ennosites.</p>\n<p>An ennosite's form physically embodies of its thought and purpose. As some ideals and goals are shared, so are certain forms.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Periodically, stray thoughts colliding on the Astral Plane become entangled, forming a knot of rudimentary intellect. Known as iotons, these beings lack the willpower to manifest physical bodies, much less the self-awareness and vision to know what form these physical bodies might take. Instead, they manifest as ghostly, cloudlike wisps, each intermittently forming ephemeral features like alien eyes, unspeaking mouths, and shimmering symbols as iotons instinctively process their surroundings. Left alone, they might drift for ages amidst the Silver Sea.</p>\n<p>Gregariously parasitic, iotons sense and congregate around thinking beings, eagerly tearing off stray thoughts and using the harvested psychic energy to think clearly and form physical bodies. An ioton might understand that this process inflicts painful headaches in its victims, but it typically doesn't care. Not only do most of these ennosites become drunk on their newfound mental power and cling to their captured thoughts, but returning what they stole also robs an ioton of the mental bandwidth necessary to parse right from wrong. This sometimes causes a painful cycle where it repeatedly steals thoughts, apologetically surrenders them, and then blithely steals the thoughts anew.</p>\n<p>Iotons that gradually accumulate and consolidate enough mental potential form a permanent body, transforming into another type of ennosite.</p>",

Stories of ogre gluttons being tricked into eating razor-edged shields or barrels filled with poisoned meat are common, but such tales are of little consolation to those who have been gobbled down whole by these ravenous giants. In addition to their sadistic table manners, ogre gluttons have a disturbing knack for coming up with violent \"games\" that are little more than drawn-out torments, yet those who somehow manage to beat a glutton at the rules of its own game can often enrage and frustrate the ogre enough that the resulting tantrum is more than enough distraction to afford a last-ditch escape from doom.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Ogres embody brutish, amoral violence and cruelty. Standing 10 feet tall and densely muscled, ogres are as strong as they are cruel. Ogres are sadists that enjoy remorseless murder, torture, degradation, and mutilation in all of its forms. Although they prefer to vent their violent urges on smaller humanoids-the smaller and more beautiful, the better-ogres promise a horrifying fate for anyone unlucky enough to fall within their meaty grasp. But for all their creativity in developing methods of violence, ogres often remain too dim-witted to realize that their playthings lack an ogre's robust fortitude and high pain tolerance, so most captives die far sooner than the ogres might prefer. Such a fate is perhaps preferable however, as those who survive too long as ogres' playthings suffer lasting mental scars from the horrifying abuse. A captive able to keep their wits can sometimes trick the brutes by promising treasure, meatier captives, or other crude amusements, taking advantage of an ogre's limited intellect to engineer opportunities to escape.</p>\n<p>Ogres are social creatures only in the most debased sense. They gather together in groups called families, though members are not always related by blood. Ogres practice incest regularly, believing that it makes for stronger familial bonds, and most ogres are misshapen or mutated from generations of inbreeding. The most powerful ogre in any family is the \"boss\"-usually the family's patriarch or matriarch-while other ogres in the family learn to obey or risk being brutalized by the boss's loyal kin. Ogres lair in caves, crumbling ruins, or dilapidated shacks close enough to humanoid settlements or animal trails to make raiding easy. These lairs are filthy and frequently contain all-too-recognizable evidence of their depravity.</p>",

But whereas a desert drake is sleek and nimble, flying through lightning storms and siroccos with ease, the prairie drake has all the grace of a chicken, barely able to flutter clumsily up a low hill or over a boulder. Owing to their largely vestigial wings, it's no wonder prairie drakes prefer burrowing over soaring.</p>\n<p>The average prairie drake has a temperament similar to that of a wicked child who delights in tormenting others. They ambush tiny animals from underground and play with their food thoroughly before eating. To assert their supremacy over other scrubland predators, prairie drakes knock down their rivals and attack them mercilessly. They often make grisly displays from the corpses of their foes to intimidate other would-be competitors.</p>\n<p>Prairie drakes build and live in burrow mounds just beneath the surface of their environs. They make shallow tunnels in search of large insects, rodents, and ground snakes. Prairie drakes' presence helps to turn the topsoil and encourage new plant growth, supporting other animal life and making them a keystone species for the environment. Even their breath weapon leaves behind rich \"drake soil,\" coveted by farmers and gardeners for the potent effects it has on plants. Being seen as \"useful\" or \"beneficial\" annoys most prairie drakes, who believe such a reputation makes them look weak and conflicts with their \"apex predator\" mystique.

But whereas a desert drake is sleek and nimble, flying through lightning storms and siroccos with ease, the prairie drake has all the grace of a chicken, barely able to flutter clumsily up a low hill or over a boulder. Owing to their largely vestigial wings, it's no wonder prairie drakes prefer burrowing over soaring.</p>\n<p>The average prairie drake has a temperament similar to that of a wicked child who delights in tormenting others. They ambush tiny animals from underground and play with their food thoroughly before eating. To assert their supremacy over other scrubland predators, prairie drakes knock down their rivals and attack them mercilessly. They often make grisly displays from the corpses of their foes to intimidate other would-be competitors.</p>\n<p>Prairie drakes build and live in burrow mounds just beneath the surface of their environs. They make shallow tunnels in search of large insects, rodents, and ground snakes. Prairie drakes' presence helps to turn the topsoil and encourage new plant growth, supporting other animal life and making them a keystone species for the environment. Even their breath weapon leaves behind rich \"drake soil,\" coveted by farmers and gardeners for the potent effects it has on plants. Being seen as \"useful\" or \"beneficial\" annoys most prairie drakes, who believe such a reputation makes them look weak and conflicts with their \"apex predator\" mystique.

These little constructs are created for a variety of reasons-such as to serve as companions or servants-but their free will means their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers of Pharasma generally abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle of souls, and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound doll, regardless of the construct's alignment, as an important service to the Great Beyond. Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel soulbound terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living creatures is evil, and an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful Will save against the creator's Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the donor's death. A non-evil doll can only be crafted from the soul of a person who has given consent to such use before their death occurred</p>\n<p>Soulbound dolls encountered by adventurers are typically guardians of some sort; despite their diminutive size, the soul fragment's power makes the doll's flst more dangerous than a casual observer would expect. Further, it grants the doll a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy and remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their crafters as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such as golems, allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities. Though soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted during or shortly after a person's death, this doesn't affect the deceased's resurrection or progress to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal to otherwise-living prospective soul donors, though there are rumors of more expensive processes that allows someone to donate a fragment of a living soul without repercussions.</p>\n<p>The soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem typically embedded in the doll's neck or chest. The soul fragment isn't static, and the doll continues to learn from its initial state, meaning its personality and abilities can change, possibly growing closer to the donor's or moving farther afield on its own individual path. The soulbound doll's focus gem retains the doll's memories even after the doll's destruction. The the intact soul focus gem of a destroyed doll can even be placed into a new doll body by someone knowledgeable in the creation of soulbound creatures, effectively reconstituting the soulbound doll.</p>",

These mobile rat traps, bound together by a magical matrix of occult energy, were programmed to wait in ambush or chase down their prey. The first trapjaw tangles proved effective and their creators were well rewarded for their ingenious designs. Soon trapjaw tangles were deployed throughout Alkenstar, Martel, and the Gunworks. Waves of them would be sent to roam into the Spellscar Desert, and the ever-present vermin were quickly forgotten.</p>\n<p>Then disaster struck. A rogue wave of magical energy washed over an airship that carried a trapjaw tangle in its hold. The magical affliction scrambled the tangle's programming and gave the swarm just enough intellect to send it on a red frenzy through the ship. When the airship crashed into the outskirts of Alkenstar, its crew perished but the infected tangle survived to infect every trapjaw it met with the same deadly scrambling of magic. Now, trapjaw tangles are an even greater menace to society than the vermin they were originally designed to eradicate.</p>",
