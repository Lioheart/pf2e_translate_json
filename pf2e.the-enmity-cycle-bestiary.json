Occasionally, these creatures seep through planar rifts or are summoned by elementalists on the Material Plane. Sand wolves are prized as guardians for their relative intelligence, keen perception, and ability to disguise themselves, easily blending with the shifting sands in desert terrain. Cunning and agile, they fiercely pursue any creatures they ambush, no matter how nimble their prey. Sand wolves also have a remarkable ability to sing beautiful, haunting songs, and their music is considered high entertainment among djinn who inhabit the Plane of Air. Many djinni viziers and even certain Material Plane rulers seeking the attention of their peers keep at least one of these creatures in their employ to show off at special events and ceremonies. The wolves' wordless songs evoke both the strength of the earth and the power of wind to erode it.</p>\n\n<h2>The Eternal Hourglass</h2>\n<p>Deep within a cavern in the Plane of Earth is a massive, seemingly indestructible hourglass the size of a small city, its top filled with thousands of sand wolves. As each wolf reaches the opening to the bottom, they are turned to sand and do not reform, instead piling up in a huge mound. It is not clear who constructed or placed the hourglass, how the sand wolves got there, or what\u2014if anything\u2014the hourglass is timing. Some claim the wolves will break loose and rampage freely when the sand runs out, while others believe the glass is counting down to the end of time itself.</p>"

Scrapborn sometimes result from this strange convergence. Mostly, scrapborn appear to be walking piles of assorted junk, seemingly assembled at random. Their actual bodies are vaguely humanoid with delicate, spongy green skin. They secrete an adhesive that allows them to gather up debris and attach it to their bodies for protection. When these scraps eventually fall off, the scrapborn either reattaches them or replaces them with something new. Despite their resulting bulky appearance, scrapborn remain strong swimmers and display little loss of agility underwater. Scrapborn lack a centralized society, but sometimes congregate in small groups that work together for survival. Typically, this leads to ever-escalating attacks on nearby settlements as the creatures feed upon each other's resentment and work themselves up into a frenzy. They often target places with high-quality armor first so they can improve their odds of survival.</p>\n\n<h2>Pretend Knights</h2>\n<p>Some scrapborn spend a great deal of their time carefully selecting the pieces of armor and other bits they attach to their sticky skin. They might enjoy a particular color or material and cultivate their collection accordingly, striving for a cohesive design over time. A very diligent and patient\u2014or particularly wealthy\u2014scrapborn can even construct a full suit of armor this way and might even be able to pass as a knight, using their bulky armored form to bluff and intimidate anyone who might question them as they walk through a city or castle.</p>"
