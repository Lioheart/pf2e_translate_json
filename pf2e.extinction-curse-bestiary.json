The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures.

A lone herecite cut off from its creators-often because it is the sole remnant of a destroyed temple or its master has perished-may wander far and wide in search of a cabal to join. Other times, the herecite seeks out a place sacred to the deity it worshipped in life.

Like the bilebearer, gutragers lack the distinctive stench typical of most xulgaths.</p>\n<p>A gutrager's torso conceals its most disturbing feature-a densely coiled esophagus. Pressurized bladders and a muscular throat allow the gutrager to propel its esophagus outward in an explosion of yellow flesh and acidic bile; caustic stomach acid coating the esophagus makes even brief physical contact with the organ dangerous. As a last resort, the gutrager can intentionally accelerate the corrosion in its esophagus, releasing vile acid in a burst that also ends its life.</p>"

They are ideal shock troops and make a good first line of defense. When an inter-clutch conflict leads to a duel, spinesnappers are typically called upon to rise to the challenge. In this case, a spinesnapper representative from each clutch squares off for what is in theory a nonlethal wrestling match, after which the winner scrapes off some of the loser's scales as a trophy.</p>"

A wayward pedestrian, traveling at night and usually in a forest, follows distant lights with the hope that the lights belong to a fellow wayfarer, only to come face-to-face with a gangly monster. The story ends in one of three ways: the traveler appeals to the yaganty with a gift of gold (the exact sum necessary varies wildly by the telling), the yaganty slays the traveler over some incomprehensible transgression, or, even more inexplicably, the yaganty offers the lost traveler five candles in simple charity so that the light might guide them home.</p>"

A zuipnyrn's body is particularly soft and malleable, allowing it to withstand falls and other hazards. Its eye stalk has the ability to produce a blinding burst of light as a defensive measure, which allows a zuipnyrn just enough time to escape in times of danger. Even more incredibly, a zuipnyrn can emit a hypnotic aura from its eye to entrance those around it-an ability it uses to avoid conflict and to persuade bystanders into helping it escape perilous situations. As they age and grow, zuipnyrns adapt to their environment by growing additional limbs, sprouting additional sensory organs, developing gills, or otherwise altering their anatomy to suit the area.</p>"
