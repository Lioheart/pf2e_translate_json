However, a bhuta's connection to their mortal life is weak and vague, more a series of compulsions and triggers than the torturous recollections of a ghost. Thus, while a bhuta might start by hunting down and devouring those who slew their mortal form, they find no relief and soon turn to predation through their domain.</p>",

Before they know it, these unsuspecting victims have called in decadesold favors and put liens on their homes in the hope of winning back just a fraction of the pot. By then, the bone croupier has already claimed their prize-to this undead chiseler, any earnings are incidental, and the real prize is encouraging others to lose their own.</p>\n<p>Bone croupiers often enshroud themselves in thick layers of cigar smoke or voluminous robes to mask their undead nature, but they almost always wear wicked grins at the table. This smile is no ruse or part of their poker face, however-the truth is that bone croupiers truly delight in games, regardless of whether they win or lose, and despite their incredible skills of deception and trickery, most simply can't disguise their unbridled mirth.</p>",

Appearing as a corpse-like version of their living form, a cadaverous rake retains their memories and much of their personality. The first act of many cadaverous rakes is to pay a surprise visit to family and friends, unveiling their revival. If they're met with revulsion or attempts to lay them to rest, the rake typically lashes out at the perceived betrayal or departs in offended confusion. Cadaverous rakes who are appropriately feted by friends and family often retain an affection and attachment, becoming undying protectors. This isn't necessarily a good thing, however, as the cadaverous rake's undead worldview creates impossible demands. The transition to undeath corrupts previously benevolent individuals, and their single-minded focus on finding more opponents to duel cuts a bloody swath across stretches of countryside they once protected. Rarely, those who were especially virtuous retain some of their moral code, though even then their dispositions are mercurial. All, however, retain the flamboyance and swagger that made them notable in life, as quick with a quip as they are with a blade. The impulse to toy with their opponents becomes the undoing of many an overconfident rake.</p>\n<p>Though most cadaverous rakes rise after losing a duel, especially those that involved foul play, any cause of death can suffice, save for a peaceful passing in old age.</p>",

The creature manifests as an enormous, disembodied head, 10 feet in height and covered in coarse black hair, with bat-like wings and vicious fangs and talons. Daqqanoenyents are naturally conflicted creatures. As the product of the tortured wills of numerous victims, daqqanoenyents sometimes exhibit strange or contradictory behavior as various individual wills struggle for control. Their conflicting desires make daqqanoenyents relatively easy to trick or deceive, and the creatures are vulnerable to fire. One story of a daqqanoenyent encounter describes the creature attempting to eat an old woman, only to be tricked by the woman into devouring a live coal. Their mouth aflame, the daqqanoenyent fled into the wilderness, never to be seen again.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Beheaded are disembodied floating heads transformed into undead. They are natural candidates for a necromancer's \"project minion,\" due to the inexpensive cost of creation and endlessly customizable nature.

            "publicNotes": "<p>Roads are liminal spaces, existing to connect people and places but rarely destinations in and of themselves. Some see them as avenues to profit. Roadside inns can be lucrative businesses between metropolitan areas, and even villains such as bandits can earn a living plying their larcenous trade on various highways. Occasionally, a road will gain a dire reputation from banditry, treacherous terrain, or a history of deadly accidents. Despite this notoriety, such roads often remain in use simply because they are an important artery of travel or alternative routes prove impractical. On such roads, those stained with the blood of travelers or flooded with fear and anger, do death coaches ride.</p>\n<p>A death coach is the spiritual manifestation of the dangers of travel. It appears as a faintly translucent wheeled carriage pulled by one or two ghostly mounts, usually in the dead of night on a lonely bit of road. The coach and the mounts are a single spirit and can never be separated. A death coach has no driver, and anyone able to peek past the thick curtains covering the carriage windows will find the vehicle empty... unless the death coach has recently collected a soul.</p>\n<p>A palpable aura of dread surrounds a death coach, its very presence a harbinger of what is to come. A creature that dies near a death coach might have their soul trapped within. Such unfortunates manifest as incorporeal likenesses of their former selves seated within the carriage, their faces showing no emotion. They seem unaware of their fate and fail to notice anyone outside the carriage. After a death coach collects a soul or two, it rides off into the darkness with its prizes. Over the next few hours, any souls trapped within simply fade into nothingness, consigned to oblivion. Some scholars believe the death coach feeds off the souls it collects to maintain its unlife, while others think the energy of those souls eventually coalesces into another death coach, though it never appears on the same road.</p>\n<p>No one knows for certain what causes a death coach to haunt a particular road, but once one begins killing travelers for their souls, the rumors soon reach nearby communities. Sometimes, the road is abandoned entirely, leaving the death coach without sustenance. If left alone for long enough, the void energy infusing the area slowly dissipates until the road is safe to travel once more, but if even one group of misguided travelers looking for a shortcut heads down the weed-choked lane, the death coach rises from its torpor to forcefully transport these unwilling souls. If it succeeds, the cycle begins anew.</p>\n<p>Other times, the communities in the area can't afford to establish a new route (or are physically incapable of doing so, in the case of mountainous regions), and so must continue to use the haunted road. The locals often mark such roads with signs to warn outsiders of the dangers, but the surprisingly clever death coaches do their best to destroy such notices. Canny travelers passing through unknown areas at night should remain on the lookout for damaged or disturbed signs to ensure they don't heedlessly head into a death coach's domain.</p>\n<p>Destroying the death coach is the only way to render the road safe until such time as a new tragedy accumulates enough void energy to create another death coach. Some might believe this incarnation to be the first death coach returning for vengeance, but in reality, it is an entirely different undead creature. A careful inspection (which is difficult to achieve) reveals minor differences between the two death coaches, perhaps reflecting more recent carriage designs, though the newer spirit is as hungry for souls as the old.</p>",

According to the oldest holy books of serpentfolk, the first hollow serpents were raised by Ydersius. The god took the cast-off skins of great snakes and filled them with hunger and hatred, a bottomless yearning for mortal life that could never be filled. In due course, the priests of the serpentfolk learned to replicate their lord's trick, and in the millennia since the serpentfolk's fall, the knowledge has slithered into the libraries of other necromancers and sorcerers.</p>\n<p>Despite their menacing reputation and great power, hollow serpents are a relatively uncomplicated creation. They were designed first and foremost as guardians, and serpentfolk liches of a suitable level of power are sometimes accompanied by hollow serpents. A few have struck out on their own over the years, usually due to outliving their original creators. Driven by their hunger and dim intellect, they take up residence in remote ruins or deep caverns. Those that study such things believe at least one serpent, perhaps one of the original creatures made by Ydersius, survives in the mountains west of Geb.</p>",

While they are capable of long-term planning, their underlying mental turmoil simmers beneath any careful preparation, and many obrousians foil their own plans with unexpected outbursts of emotion.</p>\n<p>Obrousians are recognizable as the merfolk they once were before they died, though their bodies show obvious decay and their hands have elongated into sharp claws. Their voices are melodic and entrancing, belying their rotting bodies and turbulent minds, so some obrousians hide in tall reeds or under docks before speaking to their victims, lulling them into false comfort with a pleasant voice.</p>",

Instead, an onryo hunts down the friends, family members, and anyone connected to their foe. In doing so, the onryo inflicts as much torment as possible on the person responsible for their demise. An onryo's vengeful nature persists indefinitely; not even the death of their killer sates their lust for destruction. Vengeance is just a way for them to spread their pain to others, and they quickly find new targets for their ire. Onryos always wear funeral clothing, often dripping wet or covered in filth.

            "name": "Pale Sovereign",
            "publicNotes": "<p>A pale sovereign is a rare form of undead arising from a terrible curse that afflicts only those of royal blood. This curse drains its victim's vitality slowly over time, almost appearing to be a form of long-term wasting disease that no medicine can ever cure. The royal stricken by the curse sickens and wastes away until they finally perish, rising as a pale sovereign after death. The appearance of a pale sovereign is similar to their form in life, but so deathly pale and gaunt that no one who resists the mind-clouding effects of their aura would mistake them as living.</p>\n<p>The curse is known by many names across various worlds\u2014the Wasting, Blighted Legacy, Unraveled Heraldry\u2014but its effects are the same. After suffering the curse, members of a royal bloodline begin to die out, their descendants dwindling, until only one is left. Upon becoming the last remaining member of their line, the unfortunate royal undergoes the transformation into a pale sovereign, the power and potential of the entire line channeled into one extremely dangerous undead creature, even if the royal was relatively inconsequential and unskilled in life.</p>\n<p>The methods of inflicting the curse vary. Generally it's the result of rare occult rituals requiring a spellcaster of great power. Sometimes the curse is used to target a royal line abusing its authority, but just as often it's used by malicious forces against benevolent rulers or simply out of spite by the instigating caster. Mentioned only in whispers and veiled allusions, the curse is greatly feared by royal families who know of it. Be cautious in your dealings, the rumors say, and be careful who you spurn, for you never know what power they may wield.</p>\n<p>More rarely, a pale sovereign can arise spontaneously if the last of a royal line dies while under a curse or due to a curse, particularly if they died with tasks left unfinished or as the result of a betrayal. Any curse will do in these rare instances, and it's possible that the first pale sovereign formed in this way.</p>\n<p>Though morose and brooding, pale sovereigns are usually neutral rather than evil. They're very protective of their demesnes and whatever subjects remain to them, however, and attacking a pale sovereign's territory is the swiftest way to draw their ire. If a pale sovereign is ousted from their country's central throne, they retreat to any other holdings they might still possess and rule those.</p>\n<p>The attitudes of a pale sovereign's subjects vary. Many aren't even aware of their ruler's true nature. Among those who know the secret, some value their sovereign's protection and view them fondly. Others are uncomfortable with an undead eternal monarch, especially if the sovereign has become corrupt or bitter.</p>\n<p>A pale sovereign's territory is indelibly marked by their presence. Plants wither and blacken, struggling to grow in dry and lifeless soil. Wild animals often rise as undead unless they receive special ritual burials, leading to packs of skeletal and zombified beasts roaming the territory. Such monsters don't harm the demesne's residents but are quick to attack any intruders not bearing the sovereign's sigil. Even the living sapient inhabitants of a pale sovereign's demesne tend to have a drained, washed-out appearance, as if one step away from the grave themselves.</p>",
