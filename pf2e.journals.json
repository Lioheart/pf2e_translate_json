Though they act in many ways like natural-born shapeshifters, their twin forms actually stem from carefully developed magic.</em></p><hr /><p>As a communal and peaceful people, anadi ancestors endeavored to establish trade with the neighbors of ttheir homeland. However, these anadi soon learned that most others found their appearance to be extremely objectionable. Wishing to avoid conflict, ancient anadi retreated into isolation until they could find a solution. The answer came when their greatest scholars innovated a fusion of transmutation and illusion magic that allowed them to assume a humanoid form. The technique was developed, perfected, and eventually taught to the overwhelming majority of anadi.</p><p>Early efforts with their new approach to diplomacy have yielded much better results, though sporadic contact means that some outsiders whisper false legends about anadi, such as claims that they are humans who transform into monstrous spiders at moonrise. Even contemporary explorers have reported anadi as human-spider hybrids. The anadi people of the current day strive to slowly but surely create a world where they no longer need to hide their true nature.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Only reveal your true form to people who have earned your trust.</li><li>Openly express sympathy for misrepresented and unfairly stigmatized cultures.</li><li>Provide for those you hold dear and defend them from danger without hesitation.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Appreciate your willingness to seek nonviolent solutions to complicated problems.</li><li>Have a strong reaction to seeing your natural form.</li><li>Assume you have an affinity for druidic magic, given your ability to transform.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Anadi in their true form resemble human-sized spiders with a variety of colorations. Some tones look simple or muted while other remain striking and vibrant, with most patterns inherited from an anadi's parentage. A typical anadi measures five feet in length from their front legs to their rear legs when standing comfortably.</p><p>All anadi possesses the ability to transform into a human guise. This form can resemble any human ethnicity, but it's usually one that blends in with the region of an anadi's hatching. Anadi reach physical maturity after 13 years, going through multiple phases of molting along the way. A typical anadi lives to be about 80 years old.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Anadi live in a communal society, sharing peaceful lives farming mushrooms or weaving warm blankets. Their culture places great value on cooperation and mutual respect. Due to this cultural upbringing, anadi often have issues facing severe conflict and often come off to other ancestries as very shy. Their history of dealing with arachnophobia in other peoples-which anadi understand is often instinctual and very difficult to control-likewise means that anadi do their best to be accommodating and comforting, even in situations that aren't necessarily fair to them.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>The cooperative nature of anadi society and their dislike of violence means many anadi lean toward good alignments. They're more often neutral than chaotic or lawful, though the latter aren't unheard of.</p><p>Legends say Grandmother Spider rescued anadi people from servitude and brought them to Golarion, becoming their patron deity in the process. Her values of mutual care and playful trickery interweave into anadi culture, and even those who don't worship her tell tales of her adventures.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Anadi names are given by the members of the web marriage that raised them. Each parent contributes a single syllable, usually the first, from their own name. Older anadi who feel their identity has settled often take on or are given a phrase-title to honor them as well. Anadi who live among human populations rarely take a cover name, but some might adopt one if their given name strongly contrasts the norm in the local culture.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Altava, Anavachti, Strings-On-The-River Inkeelah, Kerialnamu, Maracha, Leaves-Shelter-Her-Feet Naiala, Orvasa, Reloana, Rivuken, Velachamon</p><h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Anadi Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Wisdom, Free</p><p><strong>Ability Flaw</strong> Constitution</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Anadi, Mwangi</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

You can do this using normal reagents and the Craft activity, or you can use special infused reagents that allow you to craft temporary items quickly and at no cost. Over time, you can create more and more alchemical items for free, and since each of them becomes more and more powerful, you advance in power dramatically, leaving behind those who don't understand your strange science.</p><p>You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.is3Oz9wt11lNq62K]{Alchemical Crafting} feat, even if you don't meet that feat's prerequisites, and you gain the four common 1st-level alchemical formulas granted by that feat. You can use this feat to create alchemical items as long as you have the items' formulas in your formula book.</p><h3><strong>Infused Reagents</strong></h3><p>You infuse reagents with your own alchemical essence, allowing you to create alchemical items at no cost. Each day during your daily preparations, you gain a number of batches of infused reagents equal to your level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use these reagents for either advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy, described below. Together, these infused reagents have light Bulk.</p><p>As soon as you make your next daily preparations, your infused reagents from the previous day's preparations are instantly destroyed, and nonpermanent effects of your previous day's infused items immediately end. While infused reagents are physical objects, they can't be duplicated, preserved, or created in any way other than your daily preparations. Any such artificial reagents lack the infusion and are useless for advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy.</p><h3><strong>Advanced Alchemy</strong></h3><p>During your daily preparations, after producing new infused reagents, you can spend batches of those infused reagents to create infused alchemical items. You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical reagent requirements. Your advanced alchemy level is equal to your level. For each batch of infused reagents you spend, choose an alchemical item of your advanced alchemy level or lower that's in your formula book, and make a batch of two of that item. These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.</p><h3><strong>Quick Alchemy</strong></h3><p>If you need a specific alchemical item on the fly, you can use your infused reagents to quickly create it with the Quick Alchemy action.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.NlEZ0piDxg9buXCL]{Quick Alchemy}<span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span></h3><p><strong>Cost</strong> 1 batch of infused reagents</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.4ftXXUCBHcf4b0MH]{Alchemist's Toolkit}, the formula for the alchemical item you're creating, and a free hand.</p><hr /><p>You swiftly mix up a short-lived alchemical item to use at a moment's notice.

The formula book contains the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical items of your choice, in addition to those you gained from Alchemical Crafting and your research field.</p><p>Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common alchemical items to your formula book.

You might have a degree from an scientific institute, correspond with other researchers in your field, or work as a genius loner.

This journal is here as a reference for GMs or players who are looking for an item but can't locate it in the system compendiums, and we have future plans to expand the ability to find items quickly even if you can't remember that <em>Scorching Ray</em> is now called <em>Blazing Bolt</em>.</p><p>In the pages of this journal you will see the feats, spells, and other items that were heavily altered, merged together, or removed from the system with this release. The remaster will not be complete until the release of Player Core 2, however this release represents the bulk of the rules changes that will happen.</p><p>One change not noted elsewhere in this journal is that the half-elf and half-orc heritages have both been renamed to match their new names in Pathfinder Player Core: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.N36ZR4lh9eCazDaN]{Aiuvarin} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.tLd8Qg82AwEbbmgX]{Dromaar} respectively.</p><p>Some items have been removed from the system as they are not compatible with the new rules. Alignment ampoules, for example, are not usable in a game without alignment. However, because we know that people want to use new releases while not fully moving to the remaster rules a copy of all of the legacy content has been made available through the PF2e Legacy Data module. This module also adds alignment back to actors.</p><p>This is not a full changelog of the remaster changes. That changelog would be exceptionally large, as many feats and spells had minor tweaks to the descriptions. A full changelog can be built from our github repository, though be aware that the diff file produced affected several thousand files, mostly in changing stored name references.</p>"}}}]]}
