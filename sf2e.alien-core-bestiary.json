It's rumored they can, with great effort, even mimic other people.</p>\n<p>While few enough people have encountered alloids for the name to truly catch on, they've become colloquially known as \"ship stealers\" in the Pact Worlds. They frequently travel in groups of three to five, hanging around spaceports and scoping out potential marks. They often look for smaller ships with crews not much larger than their pack or massive ships with many hiding places. They then slip aboard inside containers or backpacks, often during resupply cycles.</p>\n<p>Once the ship is out in space and the crew settled in, the pack gets to work, ideally taking out their targets one by one with barbs that make their prey's flesh as malleable as their own, allowing them to easily hide the bodies. After kidnapping a crew, they fly the ship to places where they can link up with other alloids\u2014or their Dominion masters\u2014to strip the starship for parts. What they do with their living prey is unknown.</p><hr /><p>Before the Gap, the Dominion of the Black had a strong presence on Aucturn and would occasionally invade other planets, such as Lost Golarion, in search of brains to devour and in pursuit of other mysterious agendas.

By floating through space, asterays gather enough sustenance to survive from their innate ability to consume latent cosmic radiation. However, asterays have one simple nutritional need that makes them a terror of the space lanes: organic matter. As space is all but devoid of organic elements for consumption, asterays resort to trailing starships, often by riding in their wake and tormenting the crew until they either abandon their posts or descend into chaos.

A single Swarm ship can carry thousands of eggs in stasis.</p><hr /><p>Developing far out in the Vast from an insectile species known as kucharns, the Swarm is considered the greatest threat in existence for several cultures. Composed of countless subcolonies, each consisting of myriad component subspecies, the Swarm is a vast host that acts in psychic union for the purpose of consuming all matter across the cosmos. Most frightening of all is the Swarm's ability to assimilate the knowledge and DNA of those they consume. Thanks to its pre-Gap development of star travel, the Swarm had already consumed innumerable systems before history short-circuited, and the Swarm's pace only accelerated once it received access to the Signal and the hyperspace dimension known as the Drift.</p>\n<p>Worlds touched by the Swarm are drained of their natural resources and rendered barren places known as huskworlds. What outsiders consider to be \"Swarm space\" is little more than a swathe of lifeless worlds that the Swarm have consumed in its reckless advance. The Swarm so thoroughly strips these worlds that surveyors struggle to find even trace amounts of inorganic resources, such as rare minerals and water. Few of these huskworlds have been thoroughly explored, as oftentimes exploration awakens inert drones, theorized to have been left behind in case the devoured system was ever colonized and repopulated. Pockets of Swarm activity exist well beyond this region of space, as the Swarm sent out countless subcolonies in the ages before the Gap, and even now, only some of them have reached their intended destinations.</p>\n<p>The Swarm is perhaps most known in the current era for two important facts. First, its assault on the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium led to the cessation of hostilities and tenuous alliance between the two powers. Second, the Swarm is the direct ancestor of the shirren species. Having broken away sometime during the Gap, shirrens found succor with the deity Hylax, who was believed to have evolved from a pre-Swarm kucharn and who turned her back on the ravenous entity the Swarm has evolved into.</p>\n<p>In recent years, the Swarm had been seen as little more than a distant boogeyman with no activities save for classified actions in the Suskillon system in the Vast. However, the recent discovery of the missing Szandite world of Krethiskar inadvertently awoke a dormant subcolony that had been responsible for the world's consumption. Since then, the newly dubbed Krethiskar subcolony has become a scourge of Near Space, engaged in an active invasion of Szandite Collective worlds and poised to spill over into other powers like the Veskarium and Pact Worlds. This rediscovered subcolony has begun rapid evolution of its components and remains cut off from the wider Swarm, but it still represents a clear danger to Near Space.</p>",

The atlapak uses plates on its carapace to direct the resulting sonic burst toward prey with uncanny accuracy.</p>\n<p>Despite their animalistic intelligence, atlapaks have an instinctive understanding of ballistics and fluid dynamics. Their antennae detect subtle changes in currents and fluid density, allowing them to detect moving targets from a great distance and calibrate their cavitation blasts accordingly. Their compound eyes detect multiple wavelengths of light and provide incredible depth perception comparable to advanced sniper scopes.</p>\n<p>Atlapaks prefer sheltered burrows that provide commanding views, such as coral reefs or low hills where they can conceal themselves and pick off prey at a distance. Though they typically stay in the silt of their underwater lairs, atlapaks can range far to mate. Historically, a spawning atlapak sticks fertilized eggs onto migrating megafauna that carry their offspring to new environs with unclaimed territory and resources. In the modern era, this behavior has led to eggs being stuck to the hulls of ships, where they can survive even in humid terrestrial environments. Juvenile atlapaks sometimes haunt a jungle or coast before returning to the safety of the ocean.</p>\n<p>Atlapaks can grow up to 10 feet long, while juveniles are typically at least 5 feet long.

They hold positions for advancing Krethiskar subcolony components, such as the multitudes of agile emganats. These biohulks are but one of the new innovations found within the ranks of the Krethiskar subcolony, and they were active during the siege of Rodnarth, where they implacably advanced through that world's treacherous swamps.</p><hr /><p>Developing far out in the Vast from an insectile species known as kucharns, the Swarm is considered the greatest threat in existence for several cultures. Composed of countless subcolonies, each consisting of myriad component subspecies, the Swarm is a vast host that acts in psychic union for the purpose of consuming all matter across the cosmos. Most frightening of all is the Swarm's ability to assimilate the knowledge and DNA of those they consume. Thanks to its pre-Gap development of star travel, the Swarm had already consumed innumerable systems before history short-circuited, and the Swarm's pace only accelerated once it received access to the Signal and the hyperspace dimension known as the Drift.</p>\n<p>Worlds touched by the Swarm are drained of their natural resources and rendered barren places known as huskworlds. What outsiders consider to be \"Swarm space\" is little more than a swathe of lifeless worlds that the Swarm have consumed in its reckless advance. The Swarm so thoroughly strips these worlds that surveyors struggle to find even trace amounts of inorganic resources, such as rare minerals and water. Few of these huskworlds have been thoroughly explored, as oftentimes exploration awakens inert drones, theorized to have been left behind in case the devoured system was ever colonized and repopulated. Pockets of Swarm activity exist well beyond this region of space, as the Swarm sent out countless subcolonies in the ages before the Gap, and even now, only some of them have reached their intended destinations.</p>\n<p>The Swarm is perhaps most known in the current era for two important facts. First, its assault on the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium led to the cessation of hostilities and tenuous alliance between the two powers. Second, the Swarm is the direct ancestor of the shirren species. Having broken away sometime during the Gap, shirrens found succor with the deity Hylax, who was believed to have evolved from a pre-Swarm kucharn and who turned her back on the ravenous entity the Swarm has evolved into.</p>\n<p>In recent years, the Swarm had been seen as little more than a distant boogeyman with no activities save for classified actions in the Suskillon system in the Vast. However, the recent discovery of the missing Szandite world of Krethiskar inadvertently awoke a dormant subcolony that had been responsible for the world's consumption. Since then, the newly dubbed Krethiskar subcolony has become a scourge of Near Space, engaged in an active invasion of Szandite Collective worlds and poised to spill over into other powers like the Veskarium and Pact Worlds. This rediscovered subcolony has begun rapid evolution of its components and remains cut off from the wider Swarm, but it still represents a clear danger to Near Space.</p>",

Originating from the distant world of Kasath, they've spread throughout the cosmos, accompanying numerous kasathas and even having a small enclave aboard the Idari worldship in the Pact Worlds. A crest-eater is a predator known for consuming the bones of their prey. They use a highly corrosive acidic venom that eats through minerals with ease. Their name comes from their history of tracking down kasathas and cracking open their prey's elongated skulls to feed on the \"bony crests\" within. As crest-eaters consume bones and other substances, they produce large mineral protrusions across their bodies. Crest-eaters are social creatures and often form prides to hunt together or join with other nearby species if they're accepted\u2014it's not uncommon to find a starship crew or local raider gang with one or more crest-eaters they've adopted. Tamers who have hunted with crest-eaters for generations craft a ceremonial cestus from their comrade's body after a crest-eater passes, a tradition still practiced to this day despite the high value and demand for crest-eater bones.</p>\n<p>Most crest-eaters can grow as long as 14 feet and about 6 feet tall (not including their noticeable mineral protrusions). Thanks to their mineral-laden composition, they often weigh in excess of 1,000 pounds, somewhat hampering their mobility in environments that can't support their girth. Young and mature crest-eaters tend to stay together in small prides, though some act as solitary hunters in environments where food sources are scarce. Especially large males frequently become increasingly aggressive as they age, and they're often driven away by the rest of the pride for both their hostility and gluttonous appetites. If these solitary beasts survive long enough, they can become unpredictable and dangerous threats that attempt to establish territory and find food by attacking desert settlements. Many kasathan epics feature one or more brave warriors defending their village against an ancient male crest-eater. Whether dispatched by local legends or eventually dying off in secret, these oversized crest-eaters can leave behind a valuable cache of minerals for enterprising adventurers.</p>",

Threatened diathas secrete hormones that prime their energy stores to combust, detonating themselves to drive off or kill predators. Even if several diathas sacrifice themselves this way, their hive rarely suffers thanks to their rapid reproductive cycle.</p>\n<p>Diathas are hardy scavengers that can convert almost any carbon-based molecules into energy. Originally, diathas consumed biowaste in underground warrens, but their appetite for hydrocarbon-based fuels and industrial runoff drew them into contact with modernized civilizations, where they quickly adapted to urban environments. Though some entrepreneurs try to use these creatures as an organic means of converting plastic waste into petrol products, most see diathas as vermin that do far more harm than good when allowed to propagate.</p>\n<p>Diathas can easily stow away in the nooks and crannies of starships, and interstellar travelers often don't notice them until it's too late. Because they can digest almost any carbon-containing matter, diathas that colonize new worlds can adapt to a wide range of biomes and persist as a threat to native species for generations. Efforts to eradicate invasive diathas carry substantial risks to the exterminators and the environment they're trying to protect, as the explosive vermin use literal scorched earth tactics to protect their hives. To make matters worse, diathas are hermaphroditic and can grow new hives from a single organism if they have sufficient food sources to multiply. As a result, the Pact Worlds and Veskarium maintain strict quarantine measures for vessels suspected of carrying diatha infestations.</p>\n<p>As diathas age, their stored internal gases allow them to become buoyant. These \"elder\" diathas instinctively take prominent roles as scouts and guards for other diathas. To create an elder diatha, apply the aerial and elite adjustments to a diatha, or increase its level using the guidelines from GM Core.</p>",

These wolf-sized components can burrow beneath the ground, and they move at great speeds to reach a location where they can set up an ambush. Then, once they detect a threat, the emganats spring forth from their burrowed positions and lay into their foes with an acidic cannon located in their mouths. The more emganats that unleash their bio-acid on foes, the faster the substance dissolves their targets in an agonizing display.</p><hr /><p>Developing far out in the Vast from an insectile species known as kucharns, the Swarm is considered the greatest threat in existence for several cultures. Composed of countless subcolonies, each consisting of myriad component subspecies, the Swarm is a vast host that acts in psychic union for the purpose of consuming all matter across the cosmos. Most frightening of all is the Swarm's ability to assimilate the knowledge and DNA of those they consume. Thanks to its pre-Gap development of star travel, the Swarm had already consumed innumerable systems before history short-circuited, and the Swarm's pace only accelerated once it received access to the Signal and the hyperspace dimension known as the Drift.</p>\n<p>Worlds touched by the Swarm are drained of their natural resources and rendered barren places known as huskworlds. What outsiders consider to be \"Swarm space\" is little more than a swathe of lifeless worlds that the Swarm have consumed in its reckless advance. The Swarm so thoroughly strips these worlds that surveyors struggle to find even trace amounts of inorganic resources, such as rare minerals and water. Few of these huskworlds have been thoroughly explored, as oftentimes exploration awakens inert drones, theorized to have been left behind in case the devoured system was ever colonized and repopulated. Pockets of Swarm activity exist well beyond this region of space, as the Swarm sent out countless subcolonies in the ages before the Gap, and even now, only some of them have reached their intended destinations.</p>\n<p>The Swarm is perhaps most known in the current era for two important facts. First, its assault on the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium led to the cessation of hostilities and tenuous alliance between the two powers. Second, the Swarm is the direct ancestor of the shirren species. Having broken away sometime during the Gap, shirrens found succor with the deity Hylax, who was believed to have evolved from a pre-Swarm kucharn and who turned her back on the ravenous entity the Swarm has evolved into.</p>\n<p>In recent years, the Swarm had been seen as little more than a distant boogeyman with no activities save for classified actions in the Suskillon system in the Vast. However, the recent discovery of the missing Szandite world of Krethiskar inadvertently awoke a dormant subcolony that had been responsible for the world's consumption. Since then, the newly dubbed Krethiskar subcolony has become a scourge of Near Space, engaged in an active invasion of Szandite Collective worlds and poised to spill over into other powers like the Veskarium and Pact Worlds. This rediscovered subcolony has begun rapid evolution of its components and remains cut off from the wider Swarm, but it still represents a clear danger to Near Space.</p>",

Whatever the case, excuba encounters have become all too common. These spectra swarms are often dispatched to infiltrate mortal worlds as spies or observers. They collect information for more powerful spectra like wyspirias to analyze and preserve. Some speculate that excubas have always lurked in the galaxy as invisible spies for other spectra, and that the Drift Crisis merely caused them to take a new, less cohesive form.</p><hr /><p>In the Great Beyond, time is measured not in hundreds, thousands, or millions of years, but rather in eons\u2014in iterations of reality itself. Only rising to prominence within the last three centuries alongside the advent and proliferation of Drift technology, spectra have thrived in a burgeoning niche of the otherwise stagnant zeitgeist of the Great Beyond.</p>\n<p>Though their origins and objectives remain shrouded in mystery, encounters with spectra revolve around new technological discoveries, sharing the knowledge of faster-than-light travel, and protecting the Drift. No one knows if spectra existed before the Drift, but their connection to the hyperspace plane is indisputable. Prominent metaphysicians believe spectra were created as amalgams of raw quintessence pulled into the Drift, just as the Drift itself grows from pieces of the Multiverse. If this is true, spectra's interest in the proliferation of Drift technology takes a subtle sinister turn, as each new Drift engine serves to harvest the Great Beyond and all its denizens for the growth of the Drift and spectra themselves.</p>",

While one rarely encounters garaggakals in the Universe, it can happen, particularly if their temporary lair exits in the Drift.</p><hr /><p>The Drift is a strange place, and the creatures native to it are stranger still. Garaggakals prove no exception. Shaped vaguely like humanoids, they have arms and legs but also sallow, rubbery skin with long, scaly tails and gauzelike wings. Most horrifyingly, their faces are almost entirely taken up by their enormous, funnel-like mouth, lined with sharp teeth. While they use these mouths for the obvious purpose of biting, they can also use its powerful suction to draw actual life force from their prey.</p>\n<p>Also known as \"Drift wraiths,\" garaggakals hunt down any living creatures that linger too long in the Drift. For garaggakals, anything that isn't a fellow garaggakal is prey. However, they're no mere mindless hunters. Garaggakals are surprisingly intelligent and prefer to dissect victims, learning all about them before eating them. Often, garaggakals take their victims apart while they're still alive. Xenobiologists have determined that garaggakals don't even technically need to eat to survive, so their relentless hunger is seemingly psychological. They do require the energy of the Drift to survive in the absence of food, however, and further need the energy of the Drift to reproduce, seeking out areas of intense radiation to absorb and then build a new offspring from their own cells. Their children are fully grown at creation.</p>\n<p>Garaggakals surprise their prey. They are quite stealthy and can even phase through solid matter, suddenly appearing on the inside of a starship\u2014bad news for whatever living creatures happen to be inside.

Garaggakal polymaths have spent their many years tormenting and tearing apart all the creatures they've encountered, and they have extensive recollection of anatomy of a wide variety of living things. They're even crueler than younger garaggakals, taking great delight in causing excruciating pain to their victims before stealing their life force. They travel much further through the Drift than their younger counterparts, driven by their insatiable desire to find and dissect new creatures.</p><hr /><p>The Drift is a strange place, and the creatures native to it are stranger still. Garaggakals prove no exception. Shaped vaguely like humanoids, they have arms and legs but also sallow, rubbery skin with long, scaly tails and gauzelike wings. Most horrifyingly, their faces are almost entirely taken up by their enormous, funnel-like mouth, lined with sharp teeth. While they use these mouths for the obvious purpose of biting, they can also use its powerful suction to draw actual life force from their prey.</p>\n<p>Also known as \"Drift wraiths,\" garaggakals hunt down any living creatures that linger too long in the Drift. For garaggakals, anything that isn't a fellow garaggakal is prey. However, they're no mere mindless hunters. Garaggakals are surprisingly intelligent and prefer to dissect victims, learning all about them before eating them. Often, garaggakals take their victims apart while they're still alive. Xenobiologists have determined that garaggakals don't even technically need to eat to survive, so their relentless hunger is seemingly psychological. They do require the energy of the Drift to survive in the absence of food, however, and further need the energy of the Drift to reproduce, seeking out areas of intense radiation to absorb and then build a new offspring from their own cells. Their children are fully grown at creation.</p>\n<p>Garaggakals surprise their prey. They are quite stealthy and can even phase through solid matter, suddenly appearing on the inside of a starship\u2014bad news for whatever living creatures happen to be inside. Con artists sell garaggakal repelling devices for travelers to use while in the Drift to prevent such visits.</p>",

Having evolved through Eox's numerous cataclysms, these serpents find sustenance from the rare bands of living creatures who visit the world, and in an odd turn, while they're consuming the living is when glass serpents are at their most vulnerable. The combination of acids and digestive fluids used in consuming a living creature also deprives the serpents of their invisibility, and canny glass serpent hunters actively tempt their quarry with animals to consume before attacking in force.</p>\n<p>Glass serpents have made their way well beyond the confines of Eox, and some have even found an accepting ecosystem in the Diaspora's strange waterway, the River Between.

Like their planet-bound kin, space nymphs guard their bonded territories from exploitation or harm.</p>\n<p>As admirers of the arts, nymphs are especially friendly toward creatives, and offering to depict a nymph in story, picture, or song is a sure way to win their favor\u2014unless the nymph doesn't like the final result and lashes out at the artist for insulting them with a mediocre product. Vidcasting and livestreaming are popular pastimes among more sociable nymphs, whether to show off their remote environments or find audiences for performances. Some nymphs entice movie crews to film in their territories, with two provisos: first, that the production not damage the environment, and second, that the nymph receive a prominent role in the film.</p>\n<p>Unless their territories are threatened, most space nymphs are friendly or indifferent to mortals, but they have long memories. Anyone visiting a space nymph's territory would be wise to research that nymph's grudges, past encounters with mortals, or any recent events in the area that might color the nymph's perspective of those traveling near their home.</p>\n<p>A mortal who demonstrates the right attitude and abilities, such as by protecting a stellar body from destruction or creating an especially beautiful work of art, might draw a space nymph's attention. From time to time, space nymphs will offer their services as mentors to solarians or mystics, though they seldom seek pupils on their own. Space nymphs rarely enter into more than one such arrangement at a time and typically only make commitments that promise to last decades or centuries, so they're extremely selective in their choice of mentee.</p>",

However, these clever creatures can manipulate their environment to trap prey. Ignursos have been observed creating large networks of burrows right before volcanic eruptions, seemingly because they understand lava flows will follow this path of least resistance. These tunnels turn to rivers of red-hot lava perfectly positioned to strand fleeing wildlife. Ignursos then return for their spoils after the worst of the eruption has passed.</p>\n<p>Ignursos have a significant impact on volcanic ecosystems. Burrowing ignursos break up solid rock\u2014often freshly deposited after an eruption\u2014kick-starting the process of soil formation that's necessary for the return of plants. Some dig too close to underground magma chambers, turning their tunnels into volcanic vents that release lava and gases.

Emerging shortly after the crash of the mysterious First Ones vessel now only known as the Wreck of the Returned, the illumantula was so named by the shobhad desert guides who first encountered the creature and compared it to the deadly spiders of the Akitonian glaciers. Other Pact Worlds citizens have taken to the name, as the closest descriptive title for the being has simply been \"a spider made of light.\"</p>\n<p>Content\u2014for now\u2014to spend its days wandering the Wreck of the Returned and the immediately surrounding area, the illumantula has only had a handful of meaningful engagements since its appearance. The first was against a group of Hellknights of the Order of the Eclipse, where the illumantula systematically unmade 80 of their best-trained troops in under two minutes. Only weeks after the engagement, a group of Stewards attempting to enter the Wreck of the Returned were discovered and engaged at the periphery of the illumantula's patrol path. Only two of 12 commandos managed to escape, and their accounts of the illumantula and its powers are contradictory, leaving the Stewards unable to make effective plans for further encounters.</p>\n<p>A strict quarantine has been set up to match the illumantula's patrol path, as calculated by the meticulous anacites of Investigation Site <strong>A01</strong>. The Aballonian constructs know the being to be related to the First Ones and dedicate their time to finding a means of communicating with the swarm of technological bits that patrol the outer wastes of the crashed starship. So far, they've had no success, and they've sent out an urgent call for linguistics and computers experts from across the Pact Worlds to travel to Akiton and aid their research.</p>\n<p>Where the anacites continue their experiments, scholars of Eloritu have uncovered a disturbing connection between the illumantula and the concept of alternate realities. Somehow, the actions of the illumantula produce fixed points in reality, where the unique powers of creatures with greater connections to the multiverse are somehow stymied or forced to adhere to the illumantula's will. The reason for this phenomenon remains a mystery, though one the anacites seem blissfully ignorant to explore.</p>\n<p>The appearance of the illumantula has led to the belief that it's a protector for the ancient technology of the mysterious First Ones. Similarities between the illumantula's technological bits and extracted data from Aballon have all but confirmed this theory. However, the association begs the question: is there just one illumantula, or is it merely one of many such highly advanced guardian constructs for the First Ones, a species who might be beyond anything the Pact Worlds could contend with?</p>",

They take on roles of minor leadership or as elite sharpshooters and commandos in a unit of other jinsuls. Warblooded often elect to sit out of engagements that they deem \"beneath\" them, opting to train up or observe fights from a distance unless they need to step in as reinforcements. These jinsuls often use their extra training time to learn how to pick out critical foes in a battle.</p><hr /><p>Jinsuls are a warlike species scattered across the Vast. Six-legged creatures with a bulbous body covered in eyes, jinsuls have notable segments of chitin along with a set of upper forelimbs for using equipment. They long ago lived in the region of space known as the Scoured Stars but eventually departed and settled on the harsh world of Rax. In recent years, the divine herald Dhurus unified the jinsuls into a cohesive force known as the Jinsul Hierocracy, which briefly retook the Scoured Stars. A joint alliance between several species and members of the Starfinder Society defeated Dhurus and scattered the jinsuls back into the Vast.</p>\n<p>With countless bases and fleets operating in deep space, jinsuls mostly act as raiders, scavenging for equipment and testing their mettle against other species. Indoctrinated to view themselves as a superior species, with only other inhabitants of the Scoured Stars having any value, jinsuls prefer to engage in short-ranged combat with their foes.</p>\n<p>Jinsuls aren't numerous enough to fill every need on the many ships and starbases they control across the galaxy. Instead, they rely on robots and automated computer systems (always commanded by at least one jinsul officer) to keep their space stations running efficiently. These systems are programmed to be just as deadly and ruthless as jinsuls themselves; even the most innocuous automated system or robot, like a garbage collector, might wield deadly weapons or contain vicious technomagical countermeasures.</p>",

Omas sometimes accidentally swallow drones and small starships, such as fighters and interceptors, and they've been known to do so deliberately when provoked.</p>\n<p>Most omas have been observed traveling alone. On occasion, omas form pods of three to five individuals and migrate across systems, on currents and schedules only they know. In very rare cases, omas gather among the rings of a planet in massive numbers. Their energy fields intermingle and react with local gases to light up large areas of space in a multicolored show.</p>\n<p>Their most enigmatic yet well known feature is their starsong. Traveling through space for billions of miles, the starsong is a haunting telepathic melody. Most people perceive starsong as crooning, slow and mournful. No one can agree on the details, suggesting that each listener hears something different. Attempts to translate starsong have failed thus far, stumping even the most brilliant magic and linguistics experts. Since the Drift Crisis, for unknown reasons pods of omas have begun bombarding Drift beacons with a seemingly new starsong frequency, in some cases causing catastrophic malfunctions.</p>",

Resembling two stacked pyramids with a white energy core of unknown composition, oscriss infuriate foes by routinely teleporting across the battlefield. Found wandering alone throughout Aballon's First One cities, the war machines were later identified in locations outside the Pact Worlds, lending credence to theories of the First Ones' expansion efforts throughout the cosmos.</p>\n<p>The oscriss defy proper engagement, staying far away from their foes and unleashing coruscating beams of energy that slice off the limbs of those unlucky enough to engage with them. They meticulously render their foes apart at extreme range using pinpoint accuracy. If pressured into a close-range engagement, they can unleash a blast of chronal energy to slow their attackers and allow themselves the time to better reposition and continue their dismembering bombardment.</p>\n<p>Like other constructs of the First Ones, these guardians refuse to communicate and defy almost all attempts to override or hack their programming.

Anacite scholars propose that the constructs were fashioned to battle foes who engaged strictly in two-dimensional warfare, and while the oscriss themselves are exceptionally capable of acting in three dimensions, they battle as though their foes could engage them only in two.</p>\n<p>It's speculated that the unique tactics and weapons employed by the oscriss are intended to deal with one specific threat: the planashars of the Planashar Dominion. The planashars hail from a different reality known as the Infinite Loop that has only two dimensions. They've recently slowly begun invading the galaxy, taking on the title of Those Who Converge and attacking Aballonian First Ones cities and the solar settlement of Noma. That the oscriss are intended to battle them only provides more evidence of some connection between the planashars and the First Ones.</p>\n<p>Because the oscriss are accustomed to fighting beings that exist only in two-dimensional space, they're vulnerable to tactics involving three dimensions\u2014attacking from multiple angles, for example. While an oscriss doesn't entirely understand such tactics, they can sense when they're being outmaneuvered with three-dimensional thinking and use their potent teleportation abilities to move into a less vulnerable position at every opportunity.</p>",

            "publicNotes": "<p>Multifold Industries, in collaboration with Zeizerer Munitions, created one of the earliest robotic remote war machines. Given the code name \"tashtari,\" the machine was engineered for swift deployment to the battlefield. The tashtari can support a strike force at range while disrupting enemy communications on the field.</p><hr /><p>The incursion began with a series of probes detected by anacites on Aballon. Strange machines with blazing sensors and articulated tentacles appeared out of nowhere, ripping through infrastructure seemingly at random and collecting intelligence all around Pact Worlds space. Panic spread fast, but since the machines always vanished without a trace, or exploded when captured, the sightings couldn't be confirmed or identified. Rumors began to circulate that the machines were a form of biotech never encountered before. Soon the Stewards became formally involved, shuttering the incidents behind the adamantine partition of top security clearance.</p>\n<p>In Sarenith of 325 ag, after dozens of military operations failed to engage the elusive probes, a wing of fighters dispatched from the Idari finally got lucky and disabled one of the machines before it could self-destruct. Coaxed into giving up some of its secrets by top Pact Worlds scientists, the biotech vessel became the prototype for the \"home grown\" remote war machines that are currently being tested for use in combat. The replicas aren't alive but are built using robotic construction templates since the core of the original biotech design has proven too complicated to reverse engineer with Pact technology.</p>\n<p>Remote war machines are proxies that can be controlled from a great distance. The original biotech war machines connect to the pilot's mind through a psychic link or unknown radio frequency. Robotic remote war machines connect to a computer via data link, allowing the pilot to control their proxy using a keyboard, virtual reality rig, or even a vidgame controller.</p>",

            "publicNotes": "<p>Sapient green orbs only recently appeared in Pact Worlds space, and wherever they appear, purple orbs are nowhere to be found. While the history and relationship between these orbs is unclear, scholars have at least discerned they communicate using the same language and share similar physiology. Their behavior, on the other hand, is quite different from purple orbs; they shun contact with others, rarely make friends, and lie whenever possible, though they aren't especially good at deception, much in the same way purple orbs aren't especially good at diplomacy, despite their best efforts. Some scholars have begun to expect that these two types of orb are somehow enemies of one another, though no records of conflict between them exist, and no sapient orb seems eager to discuss the other type in depth. Green orbs' tendency to lie about most topics further complicates the study of sapient orbs and their apparent enmity.</p>\n<p>Sapient green orbs are 3 feet in diameter, much like sapient purple orbs, but if asked about their size (or just about any other trait), they always state something slightly inaccurate\u2014three-and-a-half feet, two feet and four inches\u2014whatever they think will be more impressive or confusing for whoever they're addressing. The only trait they never lie about is their color (they all insist that every sapient green orb is exactly the same shade of green, which isn't quite true; there are slight variations). They'll gladly argue about the exact shade of green with anyone around. More than one person has theorized, after such an encounter, that sapient green orbs somehow draw sustenance from engaging others in pointless arguments, but it's more likely they don't need sustenance at all and simply enjoy such pursuits.</p>\n<p>When a sapient green orb feels they're about to lose an argument, they typically resort to using Excandescent Flash, then fly away.</p><hr /><p>These enigmatic, orb-shaped beings seem to have no home world, organized society, traditions, or religion. Sightings of the orbs are sporadic\u2014they briefly appear in large numbers, then vanish for a year or more, only to reappear in an entirely different region of space for a few months. Scholars and friends of the orbs have noticed that each time the orbs appear, their numbers have diminished.</p>\n<p>Sapient orbs occasionally form permanent bonds, merging three to six orbs (always of the same type, as far as anyone knows) into a cluster called a luminant. Only sapient orbs at advanced stages of their life cycle can form such clusters, and the merge is permanent and irrevocable. Luminants are highly intelligent but far more reclusive than other sapient orbs, making it difficult to discern their motivations or purpose in sapient orb society.</p>",

Vidcasting and livestreaming are popular pastimes among more sociable nymphs, whether to show off their remote environments or find audiences for performances. Some nymphs entice movie crews to film in their territories, with two provisos: first, that the production not damage the environment, and second, that the nymph receive a prominent role in the film.</p>\n<p>Unless their territories are threatened, most space nymphs are friendly or indifferent to mortals, but they have long memories. Anyone visiting a space nymph's territory would be wise to research that nymph's grudges, past encounters with mortals, or any recent events in the area that might color the nymph's perspective of those traveling near their home.</p>\n<p>A mortal who demonstrates the right attitude and abilities, such as by protecting a stellar body from destruction or creating an especially beautiful work of art, might draw a space nymph's attention. From time to time, space nymphs will offer their services as mentors to solarians or mystics, though they seldom seek pupils on their own. Space nymphs rarely enter into more than one such arrangement at a time and typically only make commitments that promise to last decades or centuries, so they're extremely selective in their choice of mentee.</p>",

Szynegators can usually be found in isolated or desolate areas of planets so their number can grow unimpeded. Their presence harbingers a full Swarm invasion.</p><hr /><p>Developing far out in the Vast from an insectile species known as kucharns, the Swarm is considered the greatest threat in existence for several cultures. Composed of countless subcolonies, each consisting of myriad component subspecies, the Swarm is a vast host that acts in psychic union for the purpose of consuming all matter across the cosmos. Most frightening of all is the Swarm's ability to assimilate the knowledge and DNA of those they consume. Thanks to its pre-Gap development of star travel, the Swarm had already consumed innumerable systems before history short-circuited, and the Swarm's pace only accelerated once it received access to the Signal and the hyperspace dimension known as the Drift.</p>\n<p>Worlds touched by the Swarm are drained of their natural resources and rendered barren places known as huskworlds. What outsiders consider to be \"Swarm space\" is little more than a swathe of lifeless worlds that the Swarm have consumed in its reckless advance. The Swarm so thoroughly strips these worlds that surveyors struggle to find even trace amounts of inorganic resources, such as rare minerals and water. Few of these huskworlds have been thoroughly explored, as oftentimes exploration awakens inert drones, theorized to have been left behind in case the devoured system was ever colonized and repopulated. Pockets of Swarm activity exist well beyond this region of space, as the Swarm sent out countless subcolonies in the ages before the Gap, and even now, only some of them have reached their intended destinations.</p>\n<p>The Swarm is perhaps most known in the current era for two important facts. First, its assault on the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium led to the cessation of hostilities and tenuous alliance between the two powers. Second, the Swarm is the direct ancestor of the shirren species. Having broken away sometime during the Gap, shirrens found succor with the deity Hylax, who was believed to have evolved from a pre-Swarm kucharn and who turned her back on the ravenous entity the Swarm has evolved into.</p>\n<p>In recent years, the Swarm had been seen as little more than a distant boogeyman with no activities save for classified actions in the Suskillon system in the Vast. However, the recent discovery of the missing Szandite world of Krethiskar inadvertently awoke a dormant subcolony that had been responsible for the world's consumption. Since then, the newly dubbed Krethiskar subcolony has become a scourge of Near Space, engaged in an active invasion of Szandite Collective worlds and poised to spill over into other powers like the Veskarium and Pact Worlds. This rediscovered subcolony has begun rapid evolution of its components and remains cut off from the wider Swarm, but it still represents a clear danger to Near Space.</p>",

Composed of countless subcolonies, each consisting of myriad component subspecies, the Swarm is a vast host that acts in psychic union for the purpose of consuming all matter across the cosmos. Most frightening of all is the Swarm's ability to assimilate the knowledge and DNA of those they consume. Thanks to its pre-Gap development of star travel, the Swarm had already consumed innumerable systems before history short-circuited, and the Swarm's pace only accelerated once it received access to the Signal and the hyperspace dimension known as the Drift.</p>\n<p>Worlds touched by the Swarm are drained of their natural resources and rendered barren places known as huskworlds. What outsiders consider to be \"Swarm space\" is little more than a swathe of lifeless worlds that the Swarm have consumed in its reckless advance. The Swarm so thoroughly strips these worlds that surveyors struggle to find even trace amounts of inorganic resources, such as rare minerals and water. Few of these huskworlds have been thoroughly explored, as oftentimes exploration awakens inert drones, theorized to have been left behind in case the devoured system was ever colonized and repopulated. Pockets of Swarm activity exist well beyond this region of space, as the Swarm sent out countless subcolonies in the ages before the Gap, and even now, only some of them have reached their intended destinations.</p>\n<p>The Swarm is perhaps most known in the current era for two important facts. First, its assault on the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium led to the cessation of hostilities and tenuous alliance between the two powers. Second, the Swarm is the direct ancestor of the shirren species. Having broken away sometime during the Gap, shirrens found succor with the deity Hylax, who was believed to have evolved from a pre-Swarm kucharn and who turned her back on the ravenous entity the Swarm has evolved into.</p>\n<p>In recent years, the Swarm had been seen as little more than a distant boogeyman with no activities save for classified actions in the Suskillon system in the Vast. However, the recent discovery of the missing Szandite world of Krethiskar inadvertently awoke a dormant subcolony that had been responsible for the world's consumption. Since then, the newly dubbed Krethiskar subcolony has become a scourge of Near Space, engaged in an active invasion of Szandite Collective worlds and poised to spill over into other powers like the Veskarium and Pact Worlds. This rediscovered subcolony has begun rapid evolution of its components and remains cut off from the wider Swarm, but it still represents a clear danger to Near Space.</p>",

These lumbering quadrupeds, characterized by their reptilian features and bony exoskeletons, evoke the mystery and fear often associated with ancient colossal creatures. The reason for their seclusion becomes apparent as most xenobiologists posit that the creature's gaze, capable of inducing mental distress in other species, renders habitation near veolisk territory a daunting challenge. Encounters with veolisks near established communities lead to ruthless hunts.</p>\n<p>The creatures, with their signature Void Gaze ability, have sparked speculation about their lineage. Some theories propose that veolisks descended from ancestors with more potent gaze attacks, earning them the moniker \"void basilisks\" among those versed in Lost Golarion's ancient folklore. An intriguing hypothesis suggests that millennia ago, destruction-loving cultists of the Devourer might have selectively bred the first veolisks, a narrative predating the Gap</p>\n<p>Despite their fearsome reputation, veolisks find utility as guardians for Devourer cult bases and even as pets to individuals embracing the chaos of the universe. Interestingly, veolisks are docile and harmless when equipped with blinders, veils, or other means to nullify their gaze\u2014a quirk rarely explored in cross-cultural attempts at domestication.</p>\n<p>Surviving on minimal sustenance, veolisks consume a single meal daily, feeding on flesh, fruits, fungus, or any available plant life. The physiological systems of veolisks remain a subject of study among scientists. Theories range from hyperefficient metabolisms to feeding on cosmic radiation, akin to trees photosynthesizing sunlight. A fringe notion suggests veolisks might subsist solely on background arcane energies pervasive throughout the galaxy, challenging the boundaries of scientific understanding.</p>",

Those who perish from this parasitization, a condition known as void death, rise again as void zombies.

When the immature akata within the body senses potential prey, this tendril often undulates and writhes with nauseating eagerness.</p>\n<p>Once the host body dies, the larvae feed on each other until the strongest makes its way to the victim's brain. After several hours of rapid gestation, it attaches to the brain and infuses it with a mote of necromantic energy. This process leaves the larva ravenous, driving it to consume the blood of living creatures. Void zombies tend to last several weeks as the larva grows, but eventually its host compels it to seek out a safe, secluded place where it can disgorge the larva for one last surge of growth before the host body goes inert. Several hours later, a fully formed akata emerges from the frothing puddle, typically consuming the corpse as its first meal.</p>\n<p>In general, akatas leave void zombies alone, and the larval parasites attempt to spread out to avoid competing for food. In a confined and undisturbed space, void zombies stand completely still to conserve energy. The juvenile akatas within become dormant and feed on the host body's tissue until they either reach maturity or sense a viable food source. Given the void zombie's relatively short existence, those who stumble upon a previous attack might find the void zombies already devoured or discarded and an eerie colony of silent, glassy cocoons full of ravenous hibernating akatas instead.</p>\n<p>Void zombies tend to ignore other undead, but they become inexplicably aggressive when confronted with other creatures that are infested by parasites or otherwise controlled or influenced by external forces. Many have tried experimenting with void zombie behavior by forcing them to confront, for example, a rendworm host or a creature under the thrall of a spellcaster.

Metaphysicians often explain wyspirias in contrast against iridias as spectra emissaries; where iridias travel the galaxy to share gifts of technology and information, wyspirias instead come to mortal worlds on a mission to collect and preserve mortal art and knowledge, storing it within themselves or bringing it back to the Drift for reasons as of yet unknown.</p>\n<p>Wyspirias' glass-like bodies include a cascade of tentacle-like cords descending from their waists, which they use to plug themselves directly into both people and machines. Because their tentacles can resemble the outstretched roots of a small, floating tree, the librarian spectra are sometimes known as \"trees of knowledge.\" They use their networks to transfer data and share emotional or sensory experiences between participants.</p>\n<p>Though accounts of wyspirias appearing on mortal worlds are extremely rare, they've been known to sometimes involve themselves as mediators between warring civilizations. They work to ease tense negotiations at peace talks by connecting the opposing delegates to one another, enabling various parties to experience each other's perspectives.

No one knows if spectra existed before the Drift, but their connection to the hyperspace plane is indisputable. Prominent metaphysicians believe spectra were created as amalgams of raw quintessence pulled into the Drift, just as the Drift itself grows from pieces of the Multiverse. If this is true, spectra's interest in the proliferation of Drift technology takes a subtle sinister turn, as each new Drift engine serves to harvest the Great Beyond and all its denizens for the growth of the Drift and spectra themselves.</p>",

Gas-filled and hardy, they're buffeted around by the planet's eternal storms. It's common for a cascade of these plants to be found trailing in the wake of an oma or plastered against one of the many spacecrafts and aircrafts frequenting the gas giant.</p>\n<p>The sound of zalyops bouncing against a metal hull at high velocity can be a humorous one, but travelers should be careful not to assume these plants are harmless. Zalyops are known to expel high-speed organic shrapnel by reflex. Additionally, their confusion-inducing gaseous waste easily spreads across the atmosphere and can be caught in a ship's air-intake valve.</p>\n<p>Zalyops can also cause chaos at ground level. When they float into small settlements, flocks of them will descend on small creatures, which they engulf for nutrients. The widespread befuddling clouds caused by such incursions are a dangerous nuisance. Pedestrians and pets alike must take care during such events to stay inside and simply wait the invasive balloons out.</p>\n<p>Pact Worlds chemists have developed (and patented) Balyoon, an anesthetic drug from zalyop gases. In addition to being difficult to obtain in the first place, the drug is highly unstable until refined in the laboratory, and more than one starship has been lost when its crew failed to properly store the gases they just harvested from a zalyop.</p>\n<p>Balyoon also plays a role in Eoxian soap operas and other dramatic vidshows across the Pact Worlds. It's used as a plot device in a myriad of ways, such as a villain contriving to discredit a hero or for a family member to suddenly lose their mind or memory in a soap opera. How these characters obtained the processed gas of a predatory Brethedan plant is rarely as important as the exciting drama, however.</p>",
