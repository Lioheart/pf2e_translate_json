A crysmal's hunger for gems will lead it to travel almost anywhere, even through planar tears. Occasionally, they even establish colonies on planes other than their own, should their newfound territory prove filled with crystals.</p>\n<p>A crysmal's scorpion-like body glitters with crystal. As light refracts between the facets, they concentrate and absorb it, energizing the crysmal and, some say, fueling the creature's magic.</p>\n<p>Crysmals form small communities in locations where crystals are plentiful, working alongside one another to track down anything from a common quartz to precious rubies and sapphires. Scouting parties use their innate magic to communicate with each other via light and wordless sound, as well as to seek out more crystals. However, when precious stone resources grow scarce, crysmals become independent and territorial about their supply, taking crystals from wherever they can, even seizing them from other creatures.</p>\n<p>A crysmal's drive to gather crystals is akin to the drive to reproduce. As a crysmal gathers stones, it stores them within its body. Once the crysmal has enough stored material, the parent fuses its stores into a tiny replica of itself and extrudes the infant crysmal, sometimes referred to as a shardling, into the world. The process leaves the parent weakened for a short time, until it can gather enough crystal to repair its body and begin the process anew. Infant crysmals consume crystals in a similar way. They process the raw material over a few months to grow to adult size. Thereafter, a crysmal \"eats\" stone only to heal injuries.</p>\n<h2>Internal Gems</h2>\n<p>When a crysmal dies, its body breaks into fragments of crystal. Some of these pieces are valuable, but potentially more lucrative are the gems the crysmal has stored inside its body to produce offspring. It takes semiprecious and precious stones worth 500 gp to produce an infant crysmal, though most slain crysmals have only a fraction of this amount stored. Once the stones become a new crysmal, they transform into the crystal of the infant's body, no longer the treasured material they once were.</p>"

The life-giving water that flows across Golarion, the maintenance of healthy forests, and the snows, thaws, and rains that help crops flourish all rely on the weather\u2014weather that's shaped at the whims of the winds. Anemoi are powerful beings from the Plane of Air tasked by ancient gods to guard the skies and shepherd the winds of every world across the planes. They guide the winds along their natural paths, and while neither malevolent nor malicious, an anemos has little regard for how a storm might affect any creature caught in its path.</p>\n<p>Anemoi can take several forms and shift between them as easily as they slip between the breezes. They wear humanoid guises to walk among mortals without drawing undue attention, and they transform into great, thunderous horses made of storm clouds and rain when they need to move quickly across the skies. Their true form, however, is wind coalesced into a humanoid shape, often with curling hair and feathery wings made of soft, drifting clouds.</p>\n<p>On Golarion, each of the four cardinal winds are created and directed by a quartet of cardinal anemoi. The cold north winds are guided by Boreal, bringer of winter. Austral shepherds hot winds from the south. Eural brings stormy winds from the east. Finally, the gentle winds of spring come at the call of Zephyr, from the west. These four cardinal anemoi, alongside their councils of lesser anemoi, shape and control the winds across all of Golarion. As far as anyone can tell, the cardinal anemoi don't answer to a greater authority. There are even more powerful maximal anemoi living in the Plane of Air, but they seem content to leave the Universe out of their plans.</p>\n<p>Though the cardinal anemoi try to keep a degree of separation from mortal affairs, lesser anemoi occasionally take a closer interest. Some monitor a single settlement or county, protecting, nourishing, or even vindictively destroying it. Each one has their own sets of interests. Many are vain or petty. Even more change attitudes just as quickly as the winds they guide. Pleasing an anemoi isn't a matter of following a set formula, but rather repeatedly changing course to give them what they desire for their mercurial current interests or perceived needs.</p>\n<h2>The Shape Of The Air</h2>\n<p>Anemoi on the Plane of Air are typically genderless, while those who spend time in the Universe sometimes experiment with or develop preferences for one of the genders of the mortals they watch or live close to.</p>",

Entities like nursery crawlers, living groves, and carved beasts use this to their advantage. That an elemental's wooden body can be carved and crafted, apparently without lasting harm, implies that they might not feel pain so long as their roots remain undamaged.</p>"

            "publicNotes": "<p>Some dangers lurking within the Endless Sky can doom prey before they even realize it; such are the ambush tactics of the 20-foot-tall elementals known as veldenars. Their inherent invisibility and pale, almost translucent forms make them among the most deadly creatures to call the Plane of Air home.</p>\n<p>Veldenars resemble amphibians from the Universe, albeit with myriad red eyes and an affinity for cold. Hunting along the edges of eternal storms, the event horizons of dead zones, and the banks of sky streams, veldenars prey on the lesser denizens of their home plane. They can often be found using their natural buoyancy to drift among the large chunks of magical ice that crossed onto the Plane of Air from its former border with the Plane of Water. There, they extend their tongues to trap unwary flying insects or adventurers who might happen to float by. Their multiple eyes keep watch for their next meal even while devouring current prey.</p>\n<p>The intense cold of a veldenar's stomach rapidly incapacitates its victims, allowing the predator to focus on returning to invisibility and finding a secluded spot to digest. Victims who escape the veldenar's stomach often feel chilled to the bone for days.</p>\n<p>Veldenars aren't discerning about who or what they inhale. As a result, kinds of scrap can collect in their stomachs, especially inorganic material. Those hunting veldenars often wait until the elemental needs to regurgitate debris, as this is one of the few times a veldenar can be caught in a compromising position, unable to capture anything due to their clogged esophagus.</p>\n<h2>Paired Predators</h2>\n<p>Veldenars bond in partnership for life, which can be well over a century. Utilizing their ambush pack tactics, one veldenar will often drive potential prey into their partner's clutches. Visitors to the Plane of Air should keep in mind that if they happen to spot one veldenar, another is likely close by.</p>",

Unless summoned or attacked, they rarely leave the trees upon which they first formed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>At first glance, wood elementals might not seem to have the same destructive potential as their cousins from the Planes of Fire, Water, or Air, but don't be fooled. The woods can be a dangerous place.</p>\n<p>Though some resemble animals, the elemental beasts presented here are still plants, and their life cycles reflect it. Vegetable lambs grow on rooted stalks, from which they can't be removed until they've matured (or perhaps ripened), leaving them dependent on their immediate surroundings for food. Moss sloths are little more than lumps of green fluff for the first century of their existence, only gaining limited mobility once they can grow their defensive wooden claws.</p>\n<h2>Wild But Unwild</h2>\n<p>Many wood elementals are created by kizidhars and other powerful creatures on the Plane of Wood and placed in rote roles. Populating nature preserves and sprawling estates, they can be unsure how to behave if released into the wild. They're essentially born domesticated and will likely act far differently than the wild creatures they mimic, even in natural environments. Their natural predators are few, putting the elementals at less risk, although they're still sometimes eaten by giant termites or captured by some as pets.</p>\n<h2>A Brain By Any Other Name</h2>\n<p>Even if Lady Shumunue taught the wood elementals' ancestors to mimic animals, a wood elemental's consciousness is contained not in a brain but in its root system. Entities like nursery crawlers, living groves, and carved beasts use this to their advantage. That an elemental's wooden body can be carved and crafted, apparently without lasting harm, implies that they might not feel pain so long as their roots remain undamaged.</p>",

            "publicNotes": "<p>The truth of life in the Universe is that weather controls the world. The life-giving water that flows across Golarion, the maintenance of healthy forests, and the snows, thaws, and rains that help crops flourish all rely on the weather\u2014weather that's shaped at the whims of the winds. Anemoi are powerful beings from the Plane of Air tasked by ancient gods to guard the skies and shepherd the winds of every world across the planes. They guide the winds along their natural paths, and while neither malevolent nor malicious, an anemos has little regard for how a storm might affect any creature caught in its path.</p>\n<p>Anemoi can take several forms and shift between them as easily as they slip between the breezes. They wear humanoid guises to walk among mortals without drawing undue attention, and they transform into great, thunderous horses made of storm clouds and rain when they need to move quickly across the skies. Their true form, however, is wind coalesced into a humanoid shape, often with curling hair and feathery wings made of soft, drifting clouds.</p>\n<p>On Golarion, each of the four cardinal winds are created and directed by a quartet of cardinal anemoi. The cold north winds are guided by Boreal, bringer of winter. Austral shepherds hot winds from the south. Eural brings stormy winds from the east. Finally, the gentle winds of spring come at the call of Zephyr, from the west. These four cardinal anemoi, alongside their councils of lesser anemoi, shape and control the winds across all of Golarion. As far as anyone can tell, the cardinal anemoi don't answer to a greater authority. There are even more powerful maximal anemoi living in the Plane of Air, but they seem content to leave the Universe out of their plans.</p>\n<p>Though the cardinal anemoi try to keep a degree of separation from mortal affairs, lesser anemoi occasionally take a closer interest. Some monitor a single settlement or county, protecting, nourishing, or even vindictively destroying it. Each one has their own sets of interests. Many are vain or petty. Even more change attitudes just as quickly as the winds they guide. Pleasing an anemoi isn't a matter of following a set formula, but rather repeatedly changing course to give them what they desire for their mercurial current interests or perceived needs.</p>\n<h2>The Shape Of The Air</h2>\n<p>Anemoi on the Plane of Air are typically genderless, while those who spend time in the Universe sometimes experiment with or develop preferences for one of the genders of the mortals they watch or live close to.</p>",
