Bards' songs and artists' paintings of these powerful nymphs tend to depict naiad queens in their slightly more humanoid forms, which they don when they make the rare journey into civilized lands to garner allies, gather news, or gauge threats.</p>\n<p>Most naiad queens treat those who respect their domains with kindness, but they're fierce\u2014and quick to eliminate foes. Their blinding beauty and breadth of offensive spells make naiad queens fierce opponents if forced into a fight.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Nymphs are a family of fey that take the form of beautiful humanoids with elven features and have a deep association with the natural world. The most common of their kind are the dryads, which are spirits that embody great trees, but many other kinds of nymphs exist, including naiads, who watch over bodies of water. All nymphs are guardians of some element of nature, typically a specific tree or pond, or even-in the case of nymph queens-whole forests or massive bodies of water</p>\n<h2>Nymph Queens</h2>\n<p>Nymph queens are powerful nymphs who rule over entire regions of untouched wilderness, not just single trees or ponds. Every variety of nymph can have a queen. Naiad queens are among the most prominent, and more often interact with nearby mortals. Thus, some scholars refer to naiad queens as simply \"nymphs.\"</p>",
