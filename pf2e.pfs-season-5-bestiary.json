Draugr can't speak, but expresses their malicious emotions with gurgles, as though they were eternally drowning with lungs full of water. They desire little more than to attack living creatures, especially those who sail the sea. Even when they go upon land, draugrs often drag the corpses of those they strike down back to the water, populating the depths with even more dead.</p>\n<p>Draugr rise in the haunted places of the sea, where restless spirits, swells of void energy, or supernatural storms deliver death. A corpse might rest at the bottom of the sea for some time before awakening as a draugr. Collecting detritus and organisms, a corpse becomes increasingly disgusting before it finally rises. Proximity to intelligent life can expedite this process, and an underwater explorer who happens upon a shipwreck might cause a body to snap to unlife as a draugr suddenly. The creatures don't take intrusions lightly, especially upon their place of death.</p>\n<p>Though steeped in evil, draugr are susceptible to reminders of their lives as mariners. In particular, a well-performed sea shanty or call-and-response work song might cause a draugr to become lost in reverie for a moment. The creatures have even been witnessed moaning along, unable to sing the words but providing haunting accompaniment.

This walking corpse is animated by a larval akata attached to the deceased creature's brain, using a grotesque feeding tendril that emerges from the corpse's mouth to drink blood from its victims.</p>\n<p>A void zombie typically exists for only a few months before it collapses and the larval akata crawls free from the motionless shell. When it feels the natural end of its unlife approaching, a void zombie finds a secluded place to vomit forth the nearly mature akata larva, then withers away. The disgorged larva metamorphizes into a full-grown akata several hours later, usually eating the corpse as its first meal.</p>\n<p>The name \"void zombie\" is something of a misnomer; though still compelled by necromantic energies, a void zombie is a host in the life cycle of a parasitic alien, not a mindless, reanimated corpse (despite their similar appearances). The fact that a typical void zombie shares the neutral alignment of the larval akata within, rather than the intrinsically evil nature of other zombies, has caused some scholars to push to reclassify them under other names. Suggestions have included \"void dead,\" \"akata spawn,\" or \"bloodwalker,\" but the visceral and compelling commonplace name has proven difficult to shed.</p>\n<p>The driving force behind a void zombie's violence rises from the ravenous hunger of the alien parasite that serves as the channel for its animating negative energies. Necromancers have tried often to duplicate the void zombie, but without a larval akata hosted within, the result is simply a zombie with missing jaws or, at best, one that moves faster than normal. Others have compared a captive void zombie to a captive yellow musk thrall in an attempt to discover a potential link between the two- after all, both are animated bodies controlled by a parasitic outside force. Strangely, a void zombie becomes particularly violent when encountering a yellow musk thrall, making direct comparisons of the two creatures particularly difficult, or even dangerous. The fact that a void zombie, unlike a yellow musk thrall, is actually undead may hold some clues as to the source of this strange behavior.</p>",

            "publicNotes": "<p>Pukwudgies go by many names in many regions, but those who know of them agree that defying their mischievous nature provokes their wrath.</p>\n<p>In ancient times, pukwudgies traveled to the Material Plane from the First World, perhaps in the wake of the gnome emigration. These proud fey are obsessed with displays of respect, and while they first attempted to befriend mortals, each attempt ended in tragedy as the pukwudgies perceived any potential slight as a grave insult. Mortals, fearing these reactions, began to view pukwudgies as nuisances, and pukwudgies in turn began to resent mortals and the gods that favored them. At their best, pukwudgies play cruel jokes on mortals they encounter. At their worst, they've been known to kidnap and even kill those who don't treat them with proper respect.</p>\n<p>Pukwudgies make their villages in the oldest forests, concealed under @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.HBJPsonQnWcC3qdX]{Mirage} spells and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.nA0XlPsnMNrQMpio]{Fantastic Facade} rituals. They travel freely between the Material Plane and the First World through tiny portals beneath hills, trees, or stones. No strangers to violence, pukwudgies rarely travel alone and often anoint their quills or weapons with a custom-brewed poison before entering hostile situations.</p>\n<p>Standing about 2 feet tall, a pukwudgie sports sharp quills growing from their head that extends down their back. Their skin tone varies by the region in which they live, ranging from pale gray to brown.</p>",

Proximity to intelligent life can expedite this process, and an underwater explorer who happens upon a shipwreck might cause a body to snap to unlife as a draugr suddenly. The creatures don't take intrusions lightly, especially upon their place of death.</p>\n<p>Though steeped in evil, draugr are susceptible to reminders of their lives as mariners. In particular, a well-performed sea shanty or call-and-response work song might cause a draugr to become lost in reverie for a moment. The creatures have even been witnessed moaning along, unable to sing the words but providing haunting accompaniment. The lull rarely lasts long, though, as the beauty of the song quickly becomes a reminder of the tragedy that befell the draugr, reaffirming their desire for blood and death.</p>\n<p>More powerful draugr with burning red eyes are called draugr captains. They're 3rd-level creatures with elite adjustments that can cast obscuring mist as an innate divine spell three times per day.</p>",

Their eyes glow with ghastly green light, and rotting seaweed, barnacles, and dead sea creatures cling to their bodies. Draugr can't speak, but expresses their malicious emotions with gurgles, as though they were eternally drowning with lungs full of water. They desire little more than to attack living creatures, especially those who sail the sea. Even when they go upon land, draugrs often drag the corpses of those they strike down back to the water, populating the depths with even more dead.</p>\n<p>Draugr rise in the haunted places of the sea, where restless spirits, swells of void energy, or supernatural storms deliver death. A corpse might rest at the bottom of the sea for some time before awakening as a draugr. Collecting detritus and organisms, a corpse becomes increasingly disgusting before it finally rises. Proximity to intelligent life can expedite this process, and an underwater explorer who happens upon a shipwreck might cause a body to snap to unlife as a draugr suddenly. The creatures don't take intrusions lightly, especially upon their place of death.</p>\n<p>Though steeped in evil, draugr are susceptible to reminders of their lives as mariners. In particular, a well-performed sea shanty or call-and-response work song might cause a draugr to become lost in reverie for a moment. The creatures have even been witnessed moaning along, unable to sing the words but providing haunting accompaniment. The lull rarely lasts long, though, as the beauty of the song quickly becomes a reminder of the tragedy that befell the draugr, reaffirming their desire for blood and death.</p>\n<p>More powerful draugr with burning red eyes are called draugr captains. They're 3rd-level creatures with elite adjustments that can cast obscuring mist as an innate divine spell three times per day.</p>",
