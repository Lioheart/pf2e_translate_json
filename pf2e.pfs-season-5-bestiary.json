These proud fey are obsessed with displays of respect, and while they first attempted to befriend mortals, each attempt ended in tragedy as the pukwudgies perceived any potential slight as a grave insult. Mortals, fearing these reactions, began to view pukwudgies as nuisances, and pukwudgies in turn began to resent mortals and the gods that favored them. At their best, pukwudgies play cruel jokes on mortals they encounter. At their worst, they've been known to kidnap and even kill those who don't treat them with proper respect.</p>\n<p>Pukwudgies make their villages in the oldest forests, concealed under <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.HBJPsonQnWcC3qdX]{Mirage}</em> spells and <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.nA0XlPsnMNrQMpio]{Fantastic Facade}</em> rituals.
