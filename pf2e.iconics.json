            "backstory": "<p>There are a million ways to die in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords. The natives of this brutal land are the nomadic Kellids, and they have made the best of this primal world. Amiri is one of these barbarians. Although she was blessed with a combination of independence and brawn, Amiri's childhood remained one of constant challenge.

When a tribe wished to form an alliance, they would send gifts of meat, furs, treasure, and daughters. Amiri didn't see herself as livestock, and every chance she got, she tried to one-up her brothers and cousins. When a hunter went out and caught a caribou for the tribe, she would go out and catch two. When a party of orc raiders stumbled into their hunting grounds and a tribal hero killed four, she took it upon herself to kill six. Her constant sense of competition made her few friends\u2014her brothers were both intimidated by her ferocity and enthralled by her beauty, while her sisters knew that each time she went against tradition, they would all be punished.</p>\n<p>When Amiri finally came of age, her reputation had spread beyond the Six Bears. The other tribes took to calling her the \"Soft Chieftain\" of the Six Bears, a name that humiliated her almost as much as it did her kin, inferring that they were weak for allowing one of their women to grow so independent and strong. None of the other tribes wanted any part of her\u2014her continued presence among the Six Bears caused much strife between once friendly tribes, and so the elders determined that there was but one choice\u2014Amiri had to die. The only problem was the commonly held belief that murder of one's kin was the greatest taboo and the surest path to Hell.</p>\n<p>The opportunity to be rid of their troublesome sister rose soon enough, when word came of a tribe of frost giants who had been sighted in the nearby mountains. The elders organized a warband to scout the mountains and to drive back the giants, and they made sure that Amiri was included in the band. Shocked but proud to have finally been chosen, Amiri didn't notice how the elders smiled at her eagerness to be on her way. The elders knew that Amiri's sense of competition would swiftly get her in over her head, and in secret tasked the rest of the hunters to goad her into just such a situation.</p>\n<p>The warband headed up into the Kodar foothills, and it wasn't long before they found evidence of giants. One morning, the leader of the band rushed into camp, waving a dagger the size of a man's arm over his head. The warrior claimed to have single-handedly slain a giant and to have taken his dagger, and the others in the band congratulated him on his skill and bravery. Amiri took the bait, and announced that she would return by sundown with an even greater weapon. She could have no way of knowing that the dagger was part of the deception\u2014that the warband had brought it with them as a prop to incite her into a foolish plan.</p>\n<p>What the warband themselves didn't anticipate was that Amiri would find a frost giant. After wandering the mountains, she came to an immense body at the foot of a cliff\u2014the giant had fallen to his death weeks before, and at his side lay his immense bastard sword. Although Amiri knew that she had not killed the giant, she also knew that all she needed was his sword as proof\u2014certainly her kin wouldn't think to dispute her claim with such a grand trophy. Yet when she returned to the place she had left her kin, she found the camp empty. Concerned, worried that they had fallen victim to the region's dangers, she tracked them, catching up with the warband halfway back to the tribal camp. As she approached the camp, though, she realized something was amiss\u2014they were talking of her, and they were laughing.</p>\n<p>Creeping unseen to the edge of the camp, she realized that she had been duped. She heard her kin mocking her ways, of how she had fallen for their ruse, and how even now she was likely cooking in a giant's stewpot. That they seemed grateful and so at ease with her death was not what enraged Amiri. It was the proof that her own people thought of her as a fool that did it. Eyes blazing, Amiri stepped into the camp and held her new sword out, proclaiming that even now she had bested them. The other warriors, shocked to see her alive, quickly fell back to laughter, pointing out that she could hardly wield such an ungainly weapon. Her fury growing, Amiri hefted the weapon and tried to adopt a menacing pose, but the weapon's size threw her off balance and she toppled over, much to the other barbarian's growing amusement.</p>\n<p>It was enough. With a roar, Amiri leapt back to her feet. Her rage filled her body, clouded her vision, stole over her soul. Two of the barbarians had been decapitated by her immense sword before they realized that death had come. The battle was swift and brutal, with Amiri not noticing the blows that landed on her, simply stepping from one traitor to the next and cutting them down.</p>\n<p>When her rage finally subsided, Amiri realized what she had done. She knew that the hunters had certainly deserved their fates, but they were still kin. That her reasons for murdering them were, to her, valid didn't change the ties of blood. She knew that she had cut those ties, and so she turned her back on the remains, trusting that they would be discovered by another hunting party soon enough. As she headed west into the lands of Irrisen and the unknown reaches beyond, her heart was for the first time free\u2014no longer was her future tied to traditions that would constrain her. She has come to value her oversized sword, and even though she can only truly wield it properly when her blood rage takes her, it has become as much a part of her as her fierce independence or her fiery heart. She no longer sees herself as a member of the Six Bears, but never speaks of the circumstances that forced her to flee her homeland. Some things are better left unsaid.</p>",

            "backstory": "<p>For many adventurers, wanderlust strikes at a young age when minds are impressionable and the urge to escape the doldrums of homelife become too much to resist. In other cases, there's never a choice at all\u2014being raised on the streets leaves few other options available for those who do not wish to become criminals. Rarest are those who come to adventuring late in life.</p>\n<p>This was Ezren's path to adventure. Born to a successful spice merchant in one of Absalom's more affluent districts, Ezren's childhood was pleasantly safe. As the fourth of six siblings, he never knew the responsibility implicit in being the eldest (and therefore the one expected to carry on father's trade) or the freedom of being the youngest. He enjoyed the comforts of a well-to-do family, lived in a neighborhood relatively safe from crime, and seemed poised for a life of mediocrity.</p>\n<p>That changed when his father was taken away, charged with heresy by the church of Abadar. The charges were too spurious to stick, and while his father escaped excommunication, the damage had been done\u2014his father's business fell to pieces. Shocked, dismayed, and convinced that his father was innocent, Ezren abandoned his future and spent his adult life trying to repair his father's ruined reputation. So when Ezren finally uncovered irrefutable proof of his father's guilt, and he realized he'd wasted his life on a lie, he turned his evidence over to the church and said goodbye to his home, his family, and his life.</p>\n<p>At the age of 42, Ezren is full aware that he's missed his adulthood, yet at the same time he looks forward to discovering the world, and making a difference for a cause that he believes in. His dissatisfaction with family, religion, and government left him precious little to trust but his own intellect\u2014in fighting for his father's redemption, he had become a gifted researcher, scholar, and intellectual. Lacking the spry limbs of youth, the trust in religion, the strong arm of the soldier, or the way with words of the politician, Ezren felt he had but one option open. He traveled to tarnished Oppara, capital of Taldor and one of the oldest cities of the continent of Avistan, hoping to join one of several prestigious schools of wizardry. Yet time and time again, he was turned away due to his age. No wizard seemed to want an apprentice who, in many cases, was older than them. So Ezren was forced to strike out on his own once again.</p>\n<p>Over the next decade, as he traveled Avistan, Ezren studied where he could, picking up tricks of the wizard's trade here and there. The combination of arcane study mixed with his worldly first-hand experiences have given him an edge over young wizards fresh out of apprenticeship and eager to make names for themselves. Ezren knows about the many ways the world can trick and betray you, but now he's finally begun to master the art of magic, giving him the tools to fight back.</p>",

            "name": "Feiya (Level 1)",
            "backstory": "<p>Born in a small village north of Trollheim in the Linnorm Kingdoms, the child who would come to be known as Feiya was the daughter of two Tian merchants from Minkai who had come over the crown of the world to Avistan to start a new life. Travelers by nature, they spent the short northern summers making slow loops through Hagreach and the Thanelands, facilitating trade. What few memories Feiya has of that life are happy ones: the jostling of wagons, the smell of campfires, and wandering alone through fields and forests, marveling as the wildness closed around her.</p>\n<p>That happiness came to a sudden halt on the fateful day that brought her to the attention of a recently sundered coven of witches who dwelled on the border with Irrisen. Led by a particularly cruel green hag named Nysima, the coven had lost its youngest member to a squad of Blackravens from Trollheim and was still reeling from its sudden loss of power. They witnessed the child as she skipped away from the caravan stop, following a family of deer deep into the woods, and immediately set upon her.</p>\n<p>There's no telling what cruelties the witches would have visited upon the girl had they not suffered their recent loss. As it was, another, no less horrific, fate awaited young Feiya. The two crones seized the child and whisked her away to the east, their mad cackling drowning out the young girl's terrified screams. By the time they reached their snow- and thatch-covered huts, they had given the child a new name and were already envisioning the return of their lost powers.</p>\n<p>The next twelve years were a blur of pain, terror, and misery as Feiya endured the crones' sadistic attempts to teach her their dark craft. Alternating between tutelage and torture, the witches frequently let their cruel natures impede their instruction. For while the young girl showed unmistakable promise and aptitude, she also possessed a defiance that only the harshest of punishments could suppress. On numerous occasions, Feiya tried to escape her imprisonment, only to be tracked down and captured after no more than a few hours. The retributions for these failed attempts have scarred her body and mind in ways that no magic can ever heal.</p>\n<p>One brisk autumn day, after being beaten for failing to properly brew a batch of poisonous blue whinnis, Feiya was sent off to gather herbs. While harvesting more whinnis root, she spied a fox watching her from atop a large rime-covered rock. Unlike the region's typical arctic specimens, this creature had a striking red and orange coloration that stood in stark contrast to the endless snow. There was something about the way the creature watched her that beckoned to Feiya. She approached carefully, and was astonished by his calm and focus. As she neared, the fox trotted a small distance away, turned, and gave her a look that was clearly an invitation to follow. This process was repeated again and again, and before she knew it, Feiya was following the fox on another escape attempt.</p>\n<p>By sundown, the two witches had realized Feiya's intentions. Furious, they set off in pursuit, confident that, as with all previous instances, their hunt would be brief. This time, however, Feiya had guidance. The fox led her along trails never before seen by human nor hag, staying always just ahead and out of reach. When she needed nourishment, the fox led her to game and fresh water. When she needed rest, it stood vigil while she slept. In this manner, Feiya was able to elude capture for more than two weeks.</p>\n<p>One particularly cold evening, however, Feiya's luck ran out. With her pursuers hot on her trail and the fox nowhere to be seen, she found herself trapped in a river valley surrounded on three sides by impassable mountains. Feiya could sense the witches closing in, could hear their promises of pain on the chilling wind. She took shelter in a shallow cave behind the waterfall that fed the river, a curious little grotto whose far wall was emblazoned with a crude carving of a butterfly. Like an animal run to ground, Feiya steeled herself for the coming confrontation. She had come too far this time to surrender without a fight. She determined then and there that her days of living under someone else's yoke were over. She would have her freedom, either in this life or the next.</p>\n<p>It was at that moment that the fox reappeared. Only now, there was something different in the way he approached her. He had always shown a preternatural intelligence, but as Feiya stared into his eyes, she saw a consciousness and a determination that would have frightened her had she not come to trust the animal so implicitly. As she watched him, Feiya was startled by a sudden and overwhelming flurry of sensations invading her mind. She sank, dazed, to the cave floor as the feelings slowly crystallized into coherence. Less a voice than a series of emotions, the promise it offered was unmistakable. Feiya said nothing, but her acceptance was as clear as it was quick.</p>\n<p>What followed will forever haunt Feiya's dreams. Raspy promises of pain and suffering rose above the din of the waterfall as the witches drew near to cave mouth. Feiya could see the outlines of their hunched bodies just beyond the blanket of cascading water, but before she could act, another sound arose. It started as a low rumble, then quickly gained volume, drowning out both hags and water and sending tremors through the cave floor. Then the valley erupted with the screeching and roaring of what could only have been a forest's worth of wild animals, punctured occasionally by the shrill curse of a hag.</p>\n<p>Long minutes passed as Feiya stood, too frightened to move. Then, as gradually as it began, the noise subsided until all that remained was the crash of the waterfall. Feiya crouched down behind a rocky outcropping, afraid to leave the shelter of the cave. As the minutes turned into hours, exhaustion claimed her, and, despite her anxiety, she succumbed to a fitful sleep.</p>\n<p>When dawn finally arrived, Feiya stepped out from the cave, not quite sure what she was expecting to see. A fresh blanket of snow had covered the land, hiding any clues she might have found concerning the events of the previous night. Yet the feeling of relief was palpable. The fox crept up and paused at her side. She was finally free.</p>\n<p>Feiya never discusses the events of that night, nor the particulars of the strange pact she entered into. She may one day try to track down the parents she barely remembers, but for now she is content to roam the world, relishing her freedom, seeking new experiences, and developing her newfound power. Though she desperately desires the company of others, formative years spent away from civilized society have left Feiya lacking in social graces, and her awkwardness often leads to unfortunate misunderstandings. Nevertheless, her inherent good nature tends to win out, and her occasional flares of temper are countered by her steadfast loyalty to her friends. Feiya relishes travel, and having identified the butterfly carving in the waterfall cave as the found-mark of a Desnan priest, she gladly embraces that faith, hoping that her wanderings may cast more light on who she really is\u2014and what entity fosters her magical abilities.</p>",

Led by a particularly cruel green hag named Nysima, the coven had lost its youngest member to a squad of Blackravens from Trollheim and was still reeling from its sudden loss of power. They witnessed the child as she skipped away from the caravan stop, following a family of deer deep into the woods, and immediately set upon her.</p>\n<p>There's no telling what cruelties the witches would have visited upon the girl had they not suffered their recent loss. As it was, another, no less horrific, fate awaited young Feiya. The two crones seized the child and whisked her away to the east, their mad cackling drowning out the young girl's terrified screams. By the time they reached their snow- and thatch-covered huts, they had given the child a new name and were already envisioning the return of their lost powers.</p>\n<p>The next twelve years were a blur of pain, terror, and misery as Feiya endured the crones' sadistic attempts to teach her their dark craft. Alternating between tutelage and torture, the witches frequently let their cruel natures impede their instruction. For while the young girl showed unmistakable promise and aptitude, she also possessed a defiance that only the harshest of punishments could suppress. On numerous occasions, Feiya tried to escape her imprisonment, only to be tracked down and captured after no more than a few hours. The retributions for these failed attempts have scarred her body and mind in ways that no magic can ever heal.</p>\n<p>One brisk autumn day, after being beaten for failing to properly brew a batch of poisonous blue whinnis, Feiya was sent off to gather herbs. While harvesting more whinnis root, she spied a fox watching her from atop a large rime-covered rock. Unlike the region's typical arctic specimens, this creature had a striking red and orange coloration that stood in stark contrast to the endless snow. There was something about the way the creature watched her that beckoned to Feiya. She approached carefully, and was astonished by his calm and focus. As she neared, the fox trotted a small distance away, turned, and gave her a look that was clearly an invitation to follow. This process was repeated again and again, and before she knew it, Feiya was following the fox on another escape attempt.</p>\n<p>By sundown, the two witches had realized Feiya's intentions. Furious, they set off in pursuit, confident that, as with all previous instances, their hunt would be brief. This time, however, Feiya had guidance. The fox led her along trails never before seen by human nor hag, staying always just ahead and out of reach. When she needed nourishment, the fox led her to game and fresh water. When she needed rest, it stood vigil while she slept. In this manner, Feiya was able to elude capture for more than two weeks.</p>\n<p>One particularly cold evening, however, Feiya's luck ran out. With her pursuers hot on her trail and the fox nowhere to be seen, she found herself trapped in a river valley surrounded on three sides by impassable mountains. Feiya could sense the witches closing in, could hear their promises of pain on the chilling wind. She took shelter in a shallow cave behind the waterfall that fed the river, a curious little grotto whose far wall was emblazoned with a crude carving of a butterfly. Like an animal run to ground, Feiya steeled herself for the coming confrontation. She had come too far this time to surrender without a fight. She determined then and there that her days of living under someone else's yoke were over. She would have her freedom, either in this life or the next.</p>\n<p>It was at that moment that the fox reappeared. Only now, there was something different in the way he approached her. He had always shown a preternatural intelligence, but as Feiya stared into his eyes, she saw a consciousness and a determination that would have frightened her had she not come to trust the animal so implicitly. As she watched him, Feiya was startled by a sudden and overwhelming flurry of sensations invading her mind. She sank, dazed, to the cave floor as the feelings slowly crystallized into coherence. Less a voice than a series of emotions, the promise it offered was unmistakable. Feiya said nothing, but her acceptance was as clear as it was quick.</p>\n<p>What followed will forever haunt Feiya's dreams. Raspy promises of pain and suffering rose above the din of the waterfall as the witches drew near to cave mouth. Feiya could see the outlines of their hunched bodies just beyond the blanket of cascading water, but before she could act, another sound arose. It started as a low rumble, then quickly gained volume, drowning out both hags and water and sending tremors through the cave floor. Then the valley erupted with the screeching and roaring of what could only have been a forest's worth of wild animals, punctured occasionally by the shrill curse of a hag.</p>\n<p>Long minutes passed as Feiya stood, too frightened to move. Then, as gradually as it began, the noise subsided until all that remained was the crash of the waterfall. Feiya crouched down behind a rocky outcropping, afraid to leave the shelter of the cave. As the minutes turned into hours, exhaustion claimed her, and, despite her anxiety, she succumbed to a fitful sleep.</p>\n<p>When dawn finally arrived, Feiya stepped out from the cave, not quite sure what she was expecting to see. A fresh blanket of snow had covered the land, hiding any clues she might have found concerning the events of the previous night. Yet the feeling of relief was palpable. The fox crept up and paused at her side. She was finally free.</p>\n<p>Feiya never discusses the events of that night, nor the particulars of the strange pact she entered into. She may one day try to track down the parents she barely remembers, but for now she is content to roam the world, relishing her freedom, seeking new experiences, and developing her newfound power. Though she desperately desires the company of others, formative years spent away from civilized society have left Feiya lacking in social graces, and her awkwardness often leads to unfortunate misunderstandings. Nevertheless, her inherent good nature tends to win out, and her occasional flares of temper are countered by her steadfast loyalty to her friends. Feiya relishes travel, and having identified the butterfly carving in the waterfall cave as the found-mark of a Desnan priest, she gladly embraces that faith, hoping that her wanderings may cast more light on who she really is\u2014and what entity fosters her magical abilities.</p>",

            "name": "Fumbus (Level 1)",
            "backstory": "<p>Born in Isger's Chitterwood, Fumbus's early life was practically idyllic, at least by goblin standards. The Chitterwood has been largely left to the goblins since the end of the Goblinblood Wars nearly twenty years ago, its goblin inhabitants now free of the militant influence of their hobgoblin cousins, most of whom were eradicated or driven out of Isger at the closing of the war.</p>\n<p>Fumbus had the honor of serving as apprentice to the Fire-Eater goblin clan's chief pickle-maker, a position which gave him a fair amount of standing amongst his kin. Unfortunately, Fumbus had a particular penchant for experimentation that led to spectacular failures as often as it led to new delicacies. When a particularly unstable batch of \"spicy pickle brine\" exploded in the middle of the Fire-Eater encampment, Fumbus fled the Chitterwood, fearing that the reprisal from his fellow goblins for destroying both the clan's precious pickle barrel and a significant supply of cucumbers would be swift and violent.</p>\n<p>Fumbus's initial forays into the wider world were truly terrifying. Scavenging from human farms usually ended poorly, as vicious dogs and horrifying horses would bite, chase, or stomp the poor goblin if they caught wind of his presence. The humans themselves were often even more terrifying, and Fumbus found himself fleeing pitchfork-wielding mobs with stolen, smelly shoes (easiest to find without a light and useful as either food or clothing) tucked under one arm far more often than he found a safe place to fill his belly and sleep. Fumbus's life likely would have ended at the hands of one of these mobs had he not encountered a passing half-orc Pathfinder named Droven whose initial reaction to the little goblin was humor, rather than fear or violence. Used to dealing with a certain amount of prejudice and distrust himself, Droven dissuaded the mob from pursuing their vendetta against the goblin and allowed Fumbus to accompany him on his mission.</p>\n<p>Droven's heroics entranced young Fumbus, particularly the alchemical fire and other concoctions the half-orc used to defeat his opponents. When Droven completed his mission for the Pathfinder Society, he brought Fumbus back with him to Absalom. Droven helped secure a home for the little goblin in the Puddles district, where Fumbus's presence would be less likely to cause a stir, and shared what he knew of alchemy with the eager goblin. While Fumbus was terrified at the thought of needing to write down formulas, his mind was sharp and he quickly mastered the art of reading; to Fumbus, collecting these foolishly discarded thoughts was no different than surviving off the trash and scraps left on the outskirts of towns and cities. Fumbus came up with his own system for creating and remembering formulas using small tokens engraved with pictographic runes and a series of leather cords, which he would use to bind certain ingredients in specific orders. Together these implements allowed him to practice alchemy without risking his goblin soul or precious thoughts by performing the obscene act of writing anything down. Of further benefit to Fumbus, his new home's location in the Puddles allows the little goblin to experiment with all manner of inflammable and unstable concoctions with little fear of wreaking destruction beyond the building's water-logged rooms.</p>\n<p>Droven offered to sponsor Fumbus into the Pathfinder Society, but the goblin was so impressed by Droven that he truly believed he would not be able to pass the Society's rigorous entry exams. Determined to prove himself, Fumbus busily applied his time and energy to creating new alchemical formulas and perfecting his system for recording his discoveries. As Fumbus's confidence grew, he began to believe that perhaps he might find a place in the Pathfinder Society after all. Skulking through the alleys of Absalom, Fumbus made his way to the Grand Lodge. Upon his arrival, Fumbus learned that Droven had left on a mission several weeks ago and was overdue to report in; his ship was believed lost at sea. Droven had left a letter of sponsorship as well as some funds to secure the goblin a chance to learn at the Society's institutions but Fumbus was unwilling to begin his training without the half-orc present.</p>\n<p>Months have passed and Droven has still not returned. Fumbus spends his time perfecting his alchemy, seeking news of his lost friend, and looking for opportunities to ingratiate himself to the Pathfinder Society, despite multiple assurances from the Society's members and leadership that Fumbus's welcome was already secured by his half-orc friend. Something in Fumbus's mind refuses to let go of the idea that he must prove himself to be a worthy explorer of the same caliber as Droven, whose heroics and skill are unmatched in Fumbus's view. The little goblin has made a decision that he holds sacrosanct: he will earn his entrance to the Society by either finding his friend Droven and bringing the half-orc home, or by performing a truly heroic act worthy of the reputation Droven holds in Fumbus's own eyes.</p>",

Together these implements allowed him to practice alchemy without risking his goblin soul or precious thoughts by performing the obscene act of writing anything down. Of further benefit to Fumbus, his new home's location in the Puddles allows the little goblin to experiment with all manner of inflammable and unstable concoctions with little fear of wreaking destruction beyond the building's water-logged rooms.</p>\n<p>Droven offered to sponsor Fumbus into the Pathfinder Society, but the goblin was so impressed by Droven that he truly believed he would not be able to pass the Society's rigorous entry exams. Determined to prove himself, Fumbus busily applied his time and energy to creating new alchemical formulas and perfecting his system for recording his discoveries. As Fumbus's confidence grew, he began to believe that perhaps he might find a place in the Pathfinder Society after all. Skulking through the alleys of Absalom, Fumbus made his way to the Grand Lodge. Upon his arrival, Fumbus learned that Droven had left on a mission several weeks ago and was overdue to report in; his ship was believed lost at sea. Droven had left a letter of sponsorship as well as some funds to secure the goblin a chance to learn at the Society's institutions but Fumbus was unwilling to begin his training without the half-orc present.</p>\n<p>Months have passed and Droven has still not returned. Fumbus spends his time perfecting his alchemy, seeking news of his lost friend, and looking for opportunities to ingratiate himself to the Pathfinder Society, despite multiple assurances from the Society's members and leadership that Fumbus's welcome was already secured by his half-orc friend. Something in Fumbus's mind refuses to let go of the idea that he must prove himself to be a worthy explorer of the same caliber as Droven, whose heroics and skill are unmatched in Fumbus's view. The little goblin has made a decision that he holds sacrosanct: he will earn his entrance to the Society by either finding his friend Droven and bringing the half-orc home, or by performing a truly heroic act worthy of the reputation Droven holds in Fumbus's own eyes.</p>",

            "name": "Fumbus (Level 5)",
            "backstory": "<p>Born in Isger's Chitterwood, Fumbus's early life was practically idyllic, at least by goblin standards. The Chitterwood has been largely left to the goblins since the end of the Goblinblood Wars nearly twenty years ago, its goblin inhabitants now free of the militant influence of their hobgoblin cousins, most of whom were eradicated or driven out of Isger at the closing of the war.</p>\n<p>Fumbus had the honor of serving as apprentice to the Fire-Eater goblin clan's chief pickle-maker, a position which gave him a fair amount of standing amongst his kin. Unfortunately, Fumbus had a particular penchant for experimentation that led to spectacular failures as often as it led to new delicacies. When a particularly unstable batch of \"spicy pickle brine\" exploded in the middle of the Fire-Eater encampment, Fumbus fled the Chitterwood, fearing that the reprisal from his fellow goblins for destroying both the clan's precious pickle barrel and a significant supply of cucumbers would be swift and violent.</p>\n<p>Fumbus's initial forays into the wider world were truly terrifying. Scavenging from human farms usually ended poorly, as vicious dogs and horrifying horses would bite, chase, or stomp the poor goblin if they caught wind of his presence. The humans themselves were often even more terrifying, and Fumbus found himself fleeing pitchfork-wielding mobs with stolen, smelly shoes (easiest to find without a light and useful as either food or clothing) tucked under one arm far more often than he found a safe place to fill his belly and sleep. Fumbus's life likely would have ended at the hands of one of these mobs had he not encountered a passing half-orc Pathfinder named Droven whose initial reaction to the little goblin was humor, rather than fear or violence. Used to dealing with a certain amount of prejudice and distrust himself, Droven dissuaded the mob from pursuing their vendetta against the goblin and allowed Fumbus to accompany him on his mission.</p>\n<p>Droven's heroics entranced young Fumbus, particularly the alchemical fire and other concoctions the half-orc used to defeat his opponents. When Droven completed his mission for the Pathfinder Society, he brought Fumbus back with him to Absalom. Droven helped secure a home for the little goblin in the Puddles district, where Fumbus's presence would be less likely to cause a stir, and shared what he knew of alchemy with the eager goblin. While Fumbus was terrified at the thought of needing to write down formulas, his mind was sharp and he quickly mastered the art of reading; to Fumbus, collecting these foolishly discarded thoughts was no different than surviving off the trash and scraps left on the outskirts of towns and cities. Fumbus came up with his own system for creating and remembering formulas using small tokens engraved with pictographic runes and a series of leather cords, which he would use to bind certain ingredients in specific orders. Together these implements allowed him to practice alchemy without risking his goblin soul or precious thoughts by performing the obscene act of writing anything down.

As a young dwarf, Harsk spent every spare moment outdoors under the wide skies of southeastern Varisia, particularly at night beneath the stars, where his keen vision made him a hunter without compare. While generally uninterested in his family's traditional smithing, he still inherited enough of their tinkering ability to construct his own crossbow, a heavy, highly accurate weapon that few others are able to wind. Eschewing the company of his fellows, few things made Harsk happier than crouching in a tree stand with his bow, listening to the wind through the forest leaves and waiting for deer or larger prey to wander by.</p>\n<p>That all changed twenty years ago, when his elder brother, a fine captain named Sigur, led a dwarven war band from Janderhoff against a small party of giants that had descended from the Mindspin Mountains to raid and pillage. Out of affection, Sigur offered his less-experienced sibling the chance to come and prove himself as Sigur's chief scout and second-in-command. Calm and peaceful by nature, Harsk turned him down, failing to see the honor his brother was doing him until several days after the company had departed. Traveling light and fast, Harsk caught up with his brother quickly\u2014but not quickly enough. Misjudging the size and skill of the raiding party, Sigur led his band into an ambush, where it was slaughtered to the last dwarf.</p>\n<p>With his brother's blood still fresh on his hands, Harsk went mad with rage. That night, he stalked through the giants' camp like a vengeful wraith, slaughtering giant after giant with his crossbow before melting back into the forest, only to reappear elsewhere and take another victim. When the last giant was left gurgling in the dust, Harsk took up his brother's axe and slipped off into the trees, vowing to forever be the voice of justice in the wild places, to keep balance and prevent the sacrifices of noble men like his brother.</p>\n<p>Harsk, like many of his kind, is gruff and taciturn, but there ends most of his connection to dwarven society. Something of a loner, he prefers to spend his time outdoors, communing with nature, though he occasionally travels alongside others whose goals match his own. Uninterested in the beer and ale that so characterize dwarves in the minds of human society, Harsk instead drinks pot after pot of strong tea to keep his senses sharp. While he never lets his brother's axe out of his sight, he wields it only as a last resort, knowing that his true skills lie in the hunt and striking from darkness.</p>",

Out of affection, Sigur offered his less-experienced sibling the chance to come and prove himself as Sigur's chief scout and second-in-command. Calm and peaceful by nature, Harsk turned him down, failing to see the honor his brother was doing him until several days after the company had departed. Traveling light and fast, Harsk caught up with his brother quickly\u2014but not quickly enough.

That night, he stalked through the giants' camp like a vengeful wraith, slaughtering giant after giant with his crossbow before melting back into the forest, only to reappear elsewhere and take another victim. When the last giant was left gurgling in the dust, Harsk took up his brother's axe and slipped off into the trees, vowing to forever be the voice of justice in the wild places, to keep balance and prevent the sacrifices of noble men like his brother.</p>\n<p>Harsk, like many of his kind, is gruff and taciturn, but there ends most of his connection to dwarven society. Something of a loner, he prefers to spend his time outdoors, communing with nature, though he occasionally travels alongside others whose goals match his own. Uninterested in the beer and ale that so characterize dwarves in the minds of human society, Harsk instead drinks pot after pot of strong tea to keep his senses sharp.

            "backstory": "<p>Jirelle may have been born and raised on a ship, and she might call the Shackles her homeland, but she never considered herself a pirate, even if only to distance herself from the darkest part of her childhood: her mother.</p>\n<p>Today, Jirelle is a friendly sort with a biting wit and a charming personality. She makes new friends as swiftly as she strikes with her rapier, and while she has a flair for the dramatic (why merely attack a foe when you can make a show of it with a twirl of the cape or a somersault or two?), she never favors ostentation or glory over the opportunity to help a friend in need. Jirelle understands that the strength of one's relationships with friends, allies, lovers, and family make one strong. It was her mother's failure to forge such bonds that allowed a young Jirelle to escape from a life that would have likely seen offered as sacrifice to the shark demon Ovonovo before the close of her thirteenth birthday.</p>\n<p>On the subject of her mother or her ship, the <em>Bloodcrow</em>, the typically light-hearted half-elf grows serious. Jirelle does not share the secrets of her childhood with just anyone. As such, few know how she engineered the sinking of the <em>Bloodcrow</em> and the death of her wretched elven mother off the coast of Tempest Cay. Jirelle often jokes that she befriends for life, with the playful, only slightly malicious glint in her eyes implying what might happen to those who would betray such friendship.</p>\n<p>After escaping the <em>Bloodcrow</em>, Jirelle spent some time surviving as a street rat in the alleys of Drenchport. Armed with a fine rapier and clad in her her mother's magical cloak (the only two things she managed to escape the <em>Bloodcrow</em>'s wreckage with), Jirelle kept every coin and bauble she earned in a thrice-locked chest she keeps well hidden and protected. At first, she'd hoped to save enough money to afford a move from the Shackles to distant Taldor, drawn by tales of a land where duels and extravagance and civility promised a better life. But when rumors of a strange, ghostly ship plying the sea-ways of the Shackles reached her-fearful stories of a vessel commanded by an imperious banshee and bound by undeath-Jirelle realized that in sinking the <em>Bloodcrow</em> she'd done the exact opposite of what she'd intended. Rather than spare the Shackles of a brutal pirate queen, she'd unleashed an even deadlier scourge upon the Fever Sea.</p>\n<p>Today, Jirelle seeks the funds to someday finance a ship and crew of her own. She plans not to become a pirate-for a life of plunder and cruelty holds no appeal for the daring swashbuckler-but to finish the job she started on the eve of her thirteenth birthday. Jirelle knows she can't do this on her own, though. So she seeks true and able allies, knowing that only with bravery and trust will the <em>Bloodcrow</em>'s days be numbered.</p>",

        "Korakai (Level 1)": {
            "name": "Korakai (Level 1)",
            "backstory": "<p>Korakai's earliest memory is of roiling seas. When he was but an egg, his family left the tengu homeland of Kwanlai, first trekking west to the port city of Goka before boarding a ship to the Inner Sea in search for a better life. Like many immigrants from Tian Xia, they headed for Absalom; however, where they eventually settled was not the City at the Center of the World, but the nearby Isle of Erran.</p>\n<p>Korakai hatched and grew up on those shores, running barefoot on the beaches and rocks. Each day, his mother would dive beneath the waves, holding her breath to collect shellfish, seaweed, and other ingredients that Korakai carried to his family's tavern. There, his father would cook and brew specialties both Tien and Avistani, many a mix of both. The tavern soon became a bustling place for sailors in port, and as Korakai took orders and carried drinks, he'd catch wind of stories from distant lands that he longed to see for himself.</p>\n<p>Every so often, sailors would complain of ill winds or other troubles, and wonder whether the superstitions that tengu could ward off bad luck were true. Whenever they'd ask, Korakai's father would interject, \"Kora, go tell your grandfather someone's here for him.\" The old tengu with the faded feathers was well known among the sailors for his raucous stories and his rituals to dispel misfortune. Though Korakai suspected that much of the time, his grandfather was putting on a show, he knew that whenever the older tengu asked for his \"walking stick\"\u2014a khakkhara, a ringed prayer staff that had been in the family for generations\u2014what followed would be nothing less than a glimpse of old Kwanlai. As his grandfather glided in a whirling dance over the deck of a ship, magical feather fan in one hand and staff in the other, even Korakai's clumsy grasp of the Tengu language could catch words of power amid the chiming of the staff's rings.</p>\n<p>One day, Korakai demanded to go with his grandfather out on the seas. A ferry needed to cross the channel to Kortos for much-needed medicines, despite signs of a storm, and the captain wanted a tengu on board. At first, it seemed like they would evade the worst, but the sea changes in the blink of an eye. A rogue gust pitched the vessel, almost knocking Korakai overboard, and he reached out with his hand for purchase, finding the end of his grandfather's staff. For a moment, he clutched the staff, his grandfather holding the other end\u2014then, the heirloom snapped. Korakai's hand came away with broken metal, and as the khakkhara's rings scattered into the raging sea, Korakai fell with them. The taste of salt assailed his open beak.</p>\n<p>The light from the surface growing distant, Korakai glimpsed a shadow moving through the water toward him: a feathered shape, drinking gourd in one hand. Korakai reached his hand out for help, but the figure was swept away in a twin current of air and water, and Korakai could have sworn he saw a bearded man and a long-haired woman in the spiraling riptide. Again, Korakai tried to swim toward the currents, but again, shadows clashed together\u2014a serpentine creature with a mane of lightning and a pearl-scaled sailfish battled a dragon with salt talons and an invisible force that churned the water into a glaring eye. Blasted back by their conflict, Korakai resigned himself to his fate and sank into the depths.</p>\n<p>He fell for minutes, for hours, for an eternity, the surface a distant memory. Against flashes of lightning that had no right shining this far down, Korakai glimpsed gods, spirits, and more primordial things. Yet he saw that each shape, no matter how powerful, always coalesced from the same elements, and always returned to them once their business was done. In that moment, Korakai understood something, and with a peal of thunder, he broke the surface of the water.</p>\n<p>On deck, Korakai coughed out seawater. The storm had ended, and though the sails were torn, the crew was miraculously unharmed. The sailors cheered for Korakai's grandfather, thinking he had warded off the tempest, but the two tengu knew that it was no jinx-eating superstition to thank, but something deeper; the storm hadn't passed at all, it had come to reside within Korakai. As he released his grip on the now-broken staff, sparks danced between his talons.</p>\n<p>In the years that followed, Korakai learned how to channel and direct\u2014never command\u2014the powers he had discovered in the tempest. As his grandfather grew older, Korakai helped more and more with the elder tengu's duties, and when he passed peacefully in his sleep one spring evening, sailors came from far and wide to witness Korakai return his ashes to the sea, each ship releasing a paper lantern to float across the waves in his memory. Not long thereafter, Korakai decided to leave the island. His parents were supportive; after all, they had crossed half of Golarion once before, why should they object to their son doing the same? Taking up his grandfather's broken staff, Korakai boarded the next ship out, trading the promise of good luck for passage to distant ports.</p>\n<p>Now, Korakai wanders the world with nothing more than the desire to see new sights and collect new experiences, above all hoping to one day visit Kwanlai for himself. Yet even so, he writes home often, sending coin for the tavern when he can, knowing that the beach he grew up on is but an ocean away.</p>",

            "name": "Korakai (Level 3)",
            "backstory": "<p>Korakai's earliest memory is of roiling seas. When he was but an egg, his family left the tengu homeland of Kwanlai, first trekking west to the port city of Goka before boarding a ship to the Inner Sea in search for a better life. Like many immigrants from Tian Xia, they headed for Absalom; however, where they eventually settled was not the City at the Center of the World, but the nearby Isle of Erran.</p>\n<p>Korakai hatched and grew up on those shores, running barefoot on the beaches and rocks. Each day, his mother would dive beneath the waves, holding her breath to collect shellfish, seaweed, and other ingredients that Korakai carried to his family's tavern. There, his father would cook and brew specialties both Tien and Avistani, many a mix of both. The tavern soon became a bustling place for sailors in port, and as Korakai took orders and carried drinks, he'd catch wind of stories from distant lands that he longed to see for himself.</p>\n<p>Every so often, sailors would complain of ill winds or other troubles, and wonder whether the superstitions that tengu could ward off bad luck were true. Whenever they'd ask, Korakai's father would interject, \"Kora, go tell your grandfather someone's here for him.\" The old tengu with the faded feathers was well known among the sailors for his raucous stories and his rituals to dispel misfortune. Though Korakai suspected that much of the time, his grandfather was putting on a show, he knew that whenever the older tengu asked for his \"walking stick\"\u2014a khakkhara, a ringed prayer staff that had been in the family for generations\u2014what followed would be nothing less than a glimpse of old Kwanlai. As his grandfather glided in a whirling dance over the deck of a ship, magical feather fan in one hand and staff in the other, even Korakai's clumsy grasp of the Tengu language could catch words of power amid the chiming of the staff's rings.</p>\n<p>One day, Korakai demanded to go with his grandfather out on the seas. A ferry needed to cross the channel to Kortos for much-needed medicines, despite signs of a storm, and the captain wanted a tengu on board. At first, it seemed like they would evade the worst, but the sea changes in the blink of an eye. A rogue gust pitched the vessel, almost knocking Korakai overboard, and he reached out with his hand for purchase, finding the end of his grandfather's staff. For a moment, he clutched the staff, his grandfather holding the other end\u2014then, the heirloom snapped. Korakai's hand came away with broken metal, and as the khakkhara's rings scattered into the raging sea, Korakai fell with them. The taste of salt assailed his open beak.</p>\n<p>The light from the surface growing distant, Korakai glimpsed a shadow moving through the water toward him: a feathered shape, drinking gourd in one hand. Korakai reached his hand out for help, but the figure was swept away in a twin current of air and water, and Korakai could have sworn he saw a bearded man and a long-haired woman in the spiraling riptide. Again, Korakai tried to swim toward the currents, but again, shadows clashed together\u2014a serpentine creature with a mane of lightning and a pearl-scaled sailfish battled a dragon with salt talons and an invisible force that churned the water into a glaring eye. Blasted back by their conflict, Korakai resigned himself to his fate and sank into the depths.</p>\n<p>He fell for minutes, for hours, for an eternity, the surface a distant memory. Against flashes of lightning that had no right shining this far down, Korakai glimpsed gods, spirits, and more primordial things. Yet he saw that each shape, no matter how powerful, always coalesced from the same elements, and always returned to them once their business was done. In that moment, Korakai understood something, and with a peal of thunder, he broke the surface of the water.</p>\n<p>On deck, Korakai coughed out seawater. The storm had ended, and though the sails were torn, the crew was miraculously unharmed. The sailors cheered for Korakai's grandfather, thinking he had warded off the tempest, but the two tengu knew that it was no jinx-eating superstition to thank, but something deeper; the storm hadn't passed at all, it had come to reside within Korakai. As he released his grip on the now-broken staff, sparks danced between his talons.</p>\n<p>In the years that followed, Korakai learned how to channel and direct\u2014never command\u2014the powers he had discovered in the tempest. As his grandfather grew older, Korakai helped more and more with the elder tengu's duties, and when he passed peacefully in his sleep one spring evening, sailors came from far and wide to witness Korakai return his ashes to the sea, each ship releasing a paper lantern to float across the waves in his memory. Not long thereafter, Korakai decided to leave the island. His parents were supportive; after all, they had crossed half of Golarion once before, why should they object to their son doing the same? Taking up his grandfather's broken staff, Korakai boarded the next ship out, trading the promise of good luck for passage to distant ports.</p>\n<p>Now, Korakai wanders the world with nothing more than the desire to see new sights and collect new experiences, above all hoping to one day visit Kwanlai for himself. Yet even so, he writes home often, sending coin for the tavern when he can, knowing that the beach he grew up on is but an ocean away.</p>",

Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots.

The more cursebound abilities you use, the more your curse worsens, but you might gain divine benefits even as it tightens its grip on your soul.</p>\n<p>Your oracular curse is expressed using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.zXZjC8HLaRoLR17U]{Cursebound} condition, a unique condition that affects only oracles. Immediately after the first time you use a cursebound ability, you become cursebound 1, and if you use a cursebound ability while you are already cursebound, you increase the value of your cursebound condition by 1 after the ability resolves. At lower levels, you can tolerate only a modest amount of divine power, and your cursebound condition can't increase beyond cursebound 2; as you grow in levels, you can open yourself to even more power and your cursebound condition can progress to 3 and finally 4. Once saturated in divine power, your soul can't absorb any more, and so you can't use a cursebound ability if you are already at your maximum cursebound condition.</p>\n<p>Your oracular curse lists the specific effects of being cursebound, which are cumulative as your curse progresses. You remain cursebound until you Refocus, which reduces your cursebound condition by 1 in addition to restoring a Focus Point. As your curse is a direct result of divine power, you cannot mitigate, reduce, or remove the effects of your curse or any ability with the cursebound trait by any means other than Refocusing. For example, if a cursebound effect makes creatures @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} from you, you can't negate that concealed condition through a magic item or spell, such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Gb7SeieEvd0pL2Eh]{Sure Strike} (though you would still benefit from the other effects of that item or spell).

        "Korakai (Level 5)": {
            "name": "Korakai (Level 5)",
            "backstory": "<p>Korakai's earliest memory is of roiling seas. When he was but an egg, his family left the tengu homeland of Kwanlai, first trekking west to the port city of Goka before boarding a ship to the Inner Sea in search for a better life. Like many immigrants from Tian Xia, they headed for Absalom; however, where they eventually settled was not the City at the Center of the World, but the nearby Isle of Erran.</p>\n<p>Korakai hatched and grew up on those shores, running barefoot on the beaches and rocks. Each day, his mother would dive beneath the waves, holding her breath to collect shellfish, seaweed, and other ingredients that Korakai carried to his family's tavern. There, his father would cook and brew specialties both Tien and Avistani, many a mix of both. The tavern soon became a bustling place for sailors in port, and as Korakai took orders and carried drinks, he'd catch wind of stories from distant lands that he longed to see for himself.</p>\n<p>Every so often, sailors would complain of ill winds or other troubles, and wonder whether the superstitions that tengu could ward off bad luck were true. Whenever they'd ask, Korakai's father would interject, \"Kora, go tell your grandfather someone's here for him.\" The old tengu with the faded feathers was well known among the sailors for his raucous stories and his rituals to dispel misfortune. Though Korakai suspected that much of the time, his grandfather was putting on a show, he knew that whenever the older tengu asked for his \"walking stick\"\u2014a khakkhara, a ringed prayer staff that had been in the family for generations\u2014what followed would be nothing less than a glimpse of old Kwanlai. As his grandfather glided in a whirling dance over the deck of a ship, magical feather fan in one hand and staff in the other, even Korakai's clumsy grasp of the Tengu language could catch words of power amid the chiming of the staff's rings.</p>\n<p>One day, Korakai demanded to go with his grandfather out on the seas. A ferry needed to cross the channel to Kortos for much-needed medicines, despite signs of a storm, and the captain wanted a tengu on board. At first, it seemed like they would evade the worst, but the sea changes in the blink of an eye. A rogue gust pitched the vessel, almost knocking Korakai overboard, and he reached out with his hand for purchase, finding the end of his grandfather's staff. For a moment, he clutched the staff, his grandfather holding the other end\u2014then, the heirloom snapped. Korakai's hand came away with broken metal, and as the khakkhara's rings scattered into the raging sea, Korakai fell with them. The taste of salt assailed his open beak.</p>\n<p>The light from the surface growing distant, Korakai glimpsed a shadow moving through the water toward him: a feathered shape, drinking gourd in one hand. Korakai reached his hand out for help, but the figure was swept away in a twin current of air and water, and Korakai could have sworn he saw a bearded man and a long-haired woman in the spiraling riptide. Again, Korakai tried to swim toward the currents, but again, shadows clashed together\u2014a serpentine creature with a mane of lightning and a pearl-scaled sailfish battled a dragon with salt talons and an invisible force that churned the water into a glaring eye. Blasted back by their conflict, Korakai resigned himself to his fate and sank into the depths.</p>\n<p>He fell for minutes, for hours, for an eternity, the surface a distant memory. Against flashes of lightning that had no right shining this far down, Korakai glimpsed gods, spirits, and more primordial things. Yet he saw that each shape, no matter how powerful, always coalesced from the same elements, and always returned to them once their business was done. In that moment, Korakai understood something, and with a peal of thunder, he broke the surface of the water.</p>\n<p>On deck, Korakai coughed out seawater. The storm had ended, and though the sails were torn, the crew was miraculously unharmed. The sailors cheered for Korakai's grandfather, thinking he had warded off the tempest, but the two tengu knew that it was no jinx-eating superstition to thank, but something deeper; the storm hadn't passed at all, it had come to reside within Korakai. As he released his grip on the now-broken staff, sparks danced between his talons.</p>\n<p>In the years that followed, Korakai learned how to channel and direct\u2014never command\u2014the powers he had discovered in the tempest. As his grandfather grew older, Korakai helped more and more with the elder tengu's duties, and when he passed peacefully in his sleep one spring evening, sailors came from far and wide to witness Korakai return his ashes to the sea, each ship releasing a paper lantern to float across the waves in his memory. Not long thereafter, Korakai decided to leave the island. His parents were supportive; after all, they had crossed half of Golarion once before, why should they object to their son doing the same? Taking up his grandfather's broken staff, Korakai boarded the next ship out, trading the promise of good luck for passage to distant ports.</p>\n<p>Now, Korakai wanders the world with nothing more than the desire to see new sights and collect new experiences, above all hoping to one day visit Kwanlai for himself. Yet even so, he writes home often, sending coin for the tavern when he can, knowing that the beach he grew up on is but an ocean away.</p>",

Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifiers and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.</p><h3>Heightening Spells</h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells.

From the remorseless evil of the undead and fiends to the cruelties born in the hearts of mortals, Sarenrae's doctrines preach swift justice delivered by the scimitar's edge. To this end, she expects her faithful to be skilled at swordplay, both as a form of martial arts promoting centering of mind and body, and so that when they do enter battle, their foes do not suffer any longer than necessary.</p>\n<p>Her priests are often categorized into these two camps\u2014those who favor redemption as a method to defeat the enemy, and those who favor the blade. Kyra is certainly one of the latter. Born in a small farming town to loving parents, Kyra grew up in the shadow of one of the Dawnflower's shrines. She was taken at a young age with the beauty of the shrine's stained glass, and the grace of the three priestesses who practiced swordplay on the nearby hill each dawn as they offered their morning prayers. When bandits attacked her small town, Kyra watched as the priestesses did their best to reason with them\u2014and when that came to naught, to end them before they could do more damage. Unfortunately, the bandits were too strong, and the village burned. Kyra was one of the few survivors, and on the smoking ruins of the shrine she swore her life and sword arm to Sarenrae, swore to protect those who could not protect themselves and to not spare the blade when the time for redemption passes.</p>\n<p>Possessed of a fierce will and pride in her faith and skills with the scimitar, Kyra has traveled far since her trial by fire. She lost her family and home that fateful day, yet where another might be consumed by anger and a thirst for revenge, Kyra has found peace in the Everlight, and in the belief that, if she can prevent even one death at evil hands, her own losses will not have been in vain.</p>",

From the remorseless evil of the undead and fiends to the cruelties born in the hearts of mortals, Sarenrae's doctrines preach swift justice delivered by the scimitar's edge. To this end, she expects her faithful to be skilled at swordplay, both as a form of martial arts promoting centering of mind and body, and so that when they do enter battle, their foes do not suffer any longer than necessary.</p>\n<p>Her priests are often categorized into these two camps\u2014those who favor redemption as a method to defeat the enemy, and those who favor the blade.

When bandits attacked her small town, Kyra watched as the priestesses did their best to reason with them\u2014and when that came to naught, to end them before they could do more damage. Unfortunately, the bandits were too strong, and the village burned. Kyra was one of the few survivors, and on the smoking ruins of the shrine she swore her life and sword arm to Sarenrae, swore to protect those who could not protect themselves and to not spare the blade when the time for redemption passes.</p>\n<p>Possessed of a fierce will and pride in her faith and skills with the scimitar, Kyra has traveled far since her trial by fire.

Her friends scattered, leaving Lini alone to face the beast. Although fascinated by the cat's power and speed, and appreciative of the animal's beauty, Lini trembled under her massive paw and tears leaked from her eyes. She knew she faced her doom, and she found it cruelly ironic how death came to claim her.</p>\n<p>Yet the leopard did not strike.</p>\n<p>\"Your friends have abandoned you,\" a calm feminine voice intoned out of Lini's sight. \"Despite the times you saved them, they left you to die.\" Although Lini could not see the woman, Lini knew of the Norn of the forest and suspected she was one of them.</p>\n<p>\"Please help me,\" Lini whispered, her chest struggling to rise under the great cat's crushing paw.</p>\n<p>\"You do not need my help, little one. You need hers.\"</p>\n<p>Lini looked at the snow leopard, deep into her eyes. She saw neither hunger or malice. Still struggling just to breathe, Lini stared into the great cat's eyes and asked, \"Will you help me?\"</p>\n<p>Inexplicably, the snow leopard lifted her paw from Lini's chest. A coughing fit then overcame the small gnome, and when she finally recovered she looked around her. The snow leopard was gone and Lini saw no sign of the Norn. She looked around frantically, suddenly alone and scared. A small gnome in a large world.</p>\n<p>\"Come back,\" Lini cried. \"Don't go! Please don't go. Don't leave me alone.\" She sank to her knees, tears afresh on her face, until she heard the sound of approaching footsteps.</p>\n<p>The snow leopard had returned. With the delicateness of a mother tending to her cubs, the great cat licked gently at Lini's face, whisking away her tears. Lini threw her arms around the leopard's neck. \"You are my friend, aren't you? I will call you Droogami. That is what we call good friends.\"</p>\n<p>Lini looked down then and picked up a stick from the forest floor before clambering up the cat's side to perch on its back.</p>\n<p>\"Let us go, then, Droogami. We have no need for this place.\"</p>\n<p>In the years since her departure from the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, Lini has collected more than a dozen sticks\u2014one from each forest or wood she visits.

Kolea the Wanderer, or Uncle Midnight, or the Tideweaver. But Nahoa's village, on a small island in the easternmost reaches of Olehala's archipelago, had none. It didn't need any; the village had plentiful rain and bountiful harvests, the seas were calm and the currents easy. But for whatever small problems might crop up\u2014a ripped sail here, a sick child in need of watching there\u2014Nahoa was always first to pitch in. The young man was no hero, but he worked hard on his family's taro farm, sharing whatever was left over with his neighbors, and he played harder, stone-bowling with friends or lava-sledding down the slopes.</p><p>The years were joyful. Planting and harvesting, watching his little sisters grow up. The New Year's games and feasts. Lazy summers swimming in the falls with that navigator from the nearby Taotake islands, before she led her merchant canoes east to distant Arcadia. For many years, all was well.</p><p>Until P\u0101mal\u014d returned. The Olehala's chants told of the demon, a massive creature of shadow and smoke, its wings silent as an owl and its belly insatiable as a shark's. Once a generation, it would appear in the skies above their island, roost on the highest mountain for one day and night, and then feed. As the creature alit and the skies darkened, the people did what they had always done and hid: some in caves, some in the forests, and some in the distant reefs. With luck, P\u0101mal\u014d would take mostly livestock, and leave.</p><p>Nahoa couldn't understand. How could they let this happen, generation after generation? The last time P\u0101mal\u014d had come, Nahoa had been too little to remember much, but the fear of black wings against the sun had been seared in his mind, the same as everyone of the nameless, easternmost island. Someone had to do something. His heart was telling Nahoa to do something.</p><p>No\u2026 it was Calling.</p><p>The Call had rung out for decades, and whether the others could not hear it or could not answer, Nahoa did not know. Without words, it implored someone to help. Nahoa was no hero\u2026 but he always helped those in need, and so he did what he always did when asked to help.</p><p>That night, Nahoa bathed in the waterfall and tidied the garden. He prepared some of his sisters' favorite food, leaving it near the cooking pit for them to find in the morning, and he picked flowers to circle the stone that remembered their mother and father. Lastly, he went to the path that led up the mountain, digging stick in hand. Nahoa sat on a stump, the farming tool over his knee. So my sisters can grow up without fear. He cut a notch into his digging stick. So Uncle doesn't go hungry this winter. Another notch. So that nice Taotake girl doesn't encounter it on the seas. With each reason to face the creature, he cut. When he'd finished counting all his reasons, his digging stick was a barbed spear. With it, he climbed the mountain to P\u0101mal\u014d's roost, and he cried out a challenge as dawn broke.</p><p>P\u0101mal\u014d paid no regard. Of course it didn't. It was ancient, the subject of songs and dances every young Olehalan learned from their grandparents, its face carved into warding stones generations ago. Nahoa was no hero. The creature snatched Nahoa in its talons, and the two left the earth behind.</p><p>High in the sky, Nahoa fought P\u0101mal\u014d. He may as well have been an ant attempting to fight the tide, for all the difference it seemed to make. Nahoa thrust his spear forward and it skittered along the demon owl's slick, black feathers, to fall to the raging waves below; he seized its wing to force it to earth but found it unyielding as a koa tree. He gave a great shout and it looked back at him, at this insignificant thing that dared to fight back, and it cocked its head. Nahoa didn't even have time to let out a gasp as his chest tore under its beak.</p><p>As pain filled him, Nahoa despaired\u2014was this all he really could do? He hadn't expected to defeat P\u0101mal\u014d, or even survive, but he had hoped he might at least wound the creature, to buy a few years' peace for his island. To show his people that this ancient horror could bleed, that it could be opposed, that it didn't have to be accepted as the price for the turning of the years. But it was for naught. Demonic shadows flooded into Nahoa's chest like a venom, and as Nahoa looked up at the sky above him, red filled his vision.</p><p>No, it didn't. The sky above him was indeed red as blood, but it was not Nahoa's. In the distance, Nahoa saw an impossible vision of two figures\u2014a beast and a warrior as well\u2014standing miles tall, bodies stretching from below the horizon to above the sky. The gods, Nahoa thought in shock, moments before one bisected the other, cutting immortality short. The heavens wept as the divine blood of the warrior god rained through the sky in a shower of sparks.</p><p>The sparks screamed past Nahoa and P\u0101mal\u014d in streaks of red and silver. One landed on P\u0101mal\u014d's wing, and in a rush of speed, the sea below was replaced by the red desert of the distant mainland. Another landed, and the desert was replaced by ocean anew, though a strange one, studded through with the remnants of shattered land and ruined towers.</p><p>A spark screamed through the air, shining with light, and its speed matched P\u0101mal\u014d and Nahoa's as they flew. The demon tore into Nahoa once more, and Nahoa clung desperately to consciousness as bone crunched. He looked to the spark. He had been Called to protect his island, to face this beast, to do something, anything, but intention was nothing without the power to see it through. Power that hung in the air now, right before him. Nahoa reached for the spark with his right hand, but P\u0101mal\u014d held him in place. He reached again, and his flesh tore to beak and talon. With a cry of pain, Nahoa reached a third time, and he seized divinity.</p><p>The spark flooded deep into Nahoa's soul. He felt death flee from his bones as divine power chased the shadows from his veins, burning them into his skin as tattoos. His power, now, as well. Nahoa wrestled P\u0101mal\u014d's talons open, finding them brittle in his grasp, and he reached out for a weapon, finding the spear dropped half a world ago in his grip once more. As he yelled a challenge anew to the creature that had terrorized his people, he felt the tiny spark of divine power within him blaze, an ember fanned into a bonfire by this single moment of glory. Nahoa thrust the spear deep into P\u0101mal\u014d's breast, and the might of gods coursed down his arm and through the weapon to detonate in a peal of light and thunder. As the demon's torn body fell to earth, Nahoa fell with it, careening toward a strange, icy shore.</p><p>Nahoa was no hero, not yet. But as consciousness slipped from his grasp, the Calling rang out around him, clearer than ever, and he knew it was what he was destined to be.</p>",

            "backstory": "<p>\"Nahoa, can you help me dig another ditch before planting season?\"</p><p>\"Nahoa, the pigs have gotten out again\u2014can you help me round them up?\"</p><p>The Olehala people, third of the four great nations of the Okaiyo Ocean, had many heroes. Kolea the Wanderer, or Uncle Midnight, or the Tideweaver. But Nahoa's village, on a small island in the easternmost reaches of Olehala's archipelago, had none. It didn't need any; the village had plentiful rain and bountiful harvests, the seas were calm and the currents easy. But for whatever small problems might crop up\u2014a ripped sail here, a sick child in need of watching there\u2014Nahoa was always first to pitch in. The young man was no hero, but he worked hard on his family's taro farm, sharing whatever was left over with his neighbors, and he played harder, stone-bowling with friends or lava-sledding down the slopes.</p><p>The years were joyful. Planting and harvesting, watching his little sisters grow up. The New Year's games and feasts. Lazy summers swimming in the falls with that navigator from the nearby Taotake islands, before she led her merchant canoes east to distant Arcadia. For many years, all was well.</p><p>Until P\u0101mal\u014d returned. The Olehala's chants told of the demon, a massive creature of shadow and smoke, its wings silent as an owl and its belly insatiable as a shark's. Once a generation, it would appear in the skies above their island, roost on the highest mountain for one day and night, and then feed. As the creature alit and the skies darkened, the people did what they had always done and hid: some in caves, some in the forests, and some in the distant reefs. With luck, P\u0101mal\u014d would take mostly livestock, and leave.</p><p>Nahoa couldn't understand. How could they let this happen, generation after generation? The last time P\u0101mal\u014d had come, Nahoa had been too little to remember much, but the fear of black wings against the sun had been seared in his mind, the same as everyone of the nameless, easternmost island. Someone had to do something. His heart was telling Nahoa to do something.</p><p>No... it was Calling.</p><p>The Call had rung out for decades, and whether the others could not hear it or could not answer, Nahoa did not know. Without words, it implored someone to help. Nahoa was no hero... but he always helped those in need, and so he did what he always did when asked to help.</p><p>That night, Nahoa bathed in the waterfall and tidied the garden. He prepared some of his sisters' favorite food, leaving it near the cooking pit for them to find in the morning, and he picked flowers to circle the stone that remembered their mother and father. Lastly, he went to the path that led up the mountain, digging stick in hand. Nahoa sat on a stump, the farming tool over his knee. So my sisters can grow up without fear. He cut a notch into his digging stick. So Uncle doesn't go hungry this winter. Another notch. So that nice Taotake girl doesn't encounter it on the seas. With each reason to face the creature, he cut. When he'd finished counting all his reasons, his digging stick was a barbed spear. With it, he climbed the mountain to P\u0101mal\u014d's roost, and he cried out a challenge as dawn broke.</p><p>P\u0101mal\u014d paid no regard. Of course it didn't. It was ancient, the subject of songs and dances every young Olehalan learned from their grandparents, its face carved into warding stones generations ago. Nahoa was no hero. The creature snatched Nahoa in its talons, and the two left the earth behind.</p><p>High in the sky, Nahoa fought P\u0101mal\u014d. He may as well have been an ant attempting to fight the tide, for all the difference it seemed to make. Nahoa thrust his spear forward and it skittered along the demon owl's slick, black feathers, to fall to the raging waves below; he seized its wing to force it to earth but found it unyielding as a koa tree. He gave a great shout and it looked back at him, at this insignificant thing that dared to fight back, and it cocked its head. Nahoa didn't even have time to let out a gasp as his chest tore under its beak.</p><p>As pain filled him, Nahoa despaired\u2014was this all he really could do? He hadn't expected to defeat P\u0101mal\u014d, or even survive, but he had hoped he might at least wound the creature, to buy a few years' peace for his island. To show his people that this ancient horror could bleed, that it could be opposed, that it didn't have to be accepted as the price for the turning of the years. But it was for naught. Demonic shadows flooded into Nahoa's chest like a venom, and as Nahoa looked up at the sky above him, red filled his vision.</p><p>No, it didn't. The sky above him was indeed red as blood, but it was not Nahoa's. In the distance, Nahoa saw an impossible vision of two figures\u2014a beast and a warrior as well\u2014standing miles tall, bodies stretching from below the horizon to above the sky. The gods, Nahoa thought in shock, moments before one bisected the other, cutting immortality short. The heavens wept as the divine blood of the warrior god rained through the sky in a shower of sparks.</p><p>The sparks screamed past Nahoa and P\u0101mal\u014d in streaks of red and silver. One landed on P\u0101mal\u014d's wing, and in a rush of speed, the sea below was replaced by the red desert of the distant mainland. Another landed, and the desert was replaced by ocean anew, though a strange one, studded through with the remnants of shattered land and ruined towers.</p><p>A spark screamed through the air, shining with light, and its speed matched P\u0101mal\u014d and Nahoa's as they flew. The demon tore into Nahoa once more, and Nahoa clung desperately to consciousness as bone crunched. He looked to the spark. He had been Called to protect his island, to face this beast, to do something, anything, but intention was nothing without the power to see it through. Power that hung in the air now, right before him. Nahoa reached for the spark with his right hand, but P\u0101mal\u014d held him in place. He reached again, and his flesh tore to beak and talon. With a cry of pain, Nahoa reached a third time, and he seized divinity.</p><p>The spark flooded deep into Nahoa's soul. He felt death flee from his bones as divine power chased the shadows from his veins, burning them into his skin as tattoos. His power, now, as well. Nahoa wrestled P\u0101mal\u014d's talons open, finding them brittle in his grasp, and he reached out for a weapon, finding the spear dropped half a world ago in his grip once more. As he yelled a challenge anew to the creature that had terrorized his people, he felt the tiny spark of divine power within him blaze, an ember fanned into a bonfire by this single moment of glory. Nahoa thrust the spear deep into P\u0101mal\u014d's breast, and the might of gods coursed down his arm and through the weapon to detonate in a peal of light and thunder. As the demon's torn body fell to earth, Nahoa fell with it, careening toward a strange, icy shore.</p><p>Nahoa was no hero, not yet. But as consciousness slipped from his grasp, the Calling rang out around him, clearer than ever, and he knew it was what he was destined to be.</p>",

            "backstory": "<p>The rule of law is only as strong as the people who uphold it, and few know this fact better than Quinn.</p>\n<p>The child of a former noble family of Galt, Quinn was raised to despise the chaos that had robbed his parents of their proper name and station, forcing them to hide as middle-class apothecaries. Yet for Quinn himself, trained as a legal clerk and never having personally known the aristocratic comforts his parents mourned, this was no true inconvenience. What frustrated him about his nation was not that power resided with the people, but rather that it was wielded in such a capricious fashion. His fellow citizens' constant false accusations and refusal to abide by court rulings\u2014not to mention the Gray Gardeners' tendency to pronounce sentences completely outside the system\u2014drove young Quinn to distraction.</p>\n<p>When Quinn was 37, having recently lost both parents to an outbreak of plague, his simmering rage finally came to a head. After the ruling faction sentenced a man to death with flagrant disregard for due process, Quinn overstepped his usual role by investigating the matter himself, turning up irrefutable proof of the man's innocence. When his attempts to reopen the case were stymied, he returned the night before the scheduled execution and set the man free\u2014only to run straight into a Gray Gardener patrol. The prisoner escaped in the ensuing fracas, and even as Quinn ran, he heard the Gardeners shouting his name.</p>\n<p>Quinn fled for the Taldan border, knowing that there was now a price on his head. Yet despite all he'd lost, he found himself laughing\u2014for here, in this tragic debacle, he had finally discovered a sense of satisfaction he'd been missing his whole life. He had upheld the law and defended the innocent in spite of government negligence and corruption. By working outside the legal system, he'd helped guide it back toward a righteous path. And he wanted more.</p>\n<p>Thus began a new chapter in Quinn's life. Roaming the nations of the Inner Sea, he constantly keeps an ear out for allegations of unjust accusations or abuses of power. When he finds one, he investigates the case himself, using a lifetime of association with law enforcement agents and detective agencies like The Sleepless to help him ferret out the truth. If the legal system seems fair, he often shows up unexpectedly at the court proceedings, presenting sworn evidence and acting as defending counsel for the accused. If he finds a court to be corrupt, he takes a more direct hand in protecting the innocent. While he respects the law, he also knows that people are imperfect, and that breaking local laws is sometimes necessary in order to uphold more universal ones. Of course, his meddling is rarely popular with the opposition, and so Quinn generally moves along as soon as he's seen justice done and taken steps to ensure that the victim won't suffer further abuses.</p>\n<p>Quinn is a genial, gentlemanly sort, quick with a joke and able to fit easily into both high society and low. His well-honed analytical mind is capable of astounding feats of logic and deduction, and he's fond of sharpening it still further with alchemical extracts learned from his parents and his own personal studies. While formidable in combat, he uses a sword cane so as not to unduly tip off his enemies to his abilities, believing that the best weapon is the one your foe never sees coming. He's loyal to his friends, and sometimes seems to have a connection in every town, yet is also wary of associating too long or too openly with his allies, knowing that his fight for justice has made him unpopular with various powerful factions.</p>\n<p>Though now well into middle age, Quinn has no intentions of slowing down. As he's fond of telling companions, \"a man needs only three things to change the world: a quick wit, a righteous heart, and a stylish coat.\"</p>",

            "backstory": "<p>The rule of law is only as strong as the people who uphold it, and few know this fact better than Quinn.</p>\n<p>The child of a former noble family of Galt, Quinn was raised to despise the chaos that had robbed his parents of their proper name and station, forcing them to hide as middle-class apothecaries. Yet for Quinn himself, trained as a legal clerk and never having personally known the aristocratic comforts his parents mourned, this was no true inconvenience. What frustrated him about his nation was not that power resided with the people, but rather that it was wielded in such a capricious fashion. His fellow citizens' constant false accusations and refusal to abide by court rulings\u2014not to mention the Gray Gardeners' tendency to pronounce sentences completely outside the system\u2014drove young Quinn to distraction.</p>\n<p>When Quinn was 37, having recently lost both parents to an outbreak of plague, his simmering rage finally came to a head. After the ruling faction sentenced a man to death with flagrant disregard for due process, Quinn overstepped his usual role by investigating the matter himself, turning up irrefutable proof of the man's innocence. When his attempts to reopen the case were stymied, he returned the night before the scheduled execution and set the man free\u2014only to run straight into a Gray Gardener patrol. The prisoner escaped in the ensuing fracas, and even as Quinn ran, he heard the Gardeners shouting his name.</p>\n<p>Quinn fled for the Taldan border, knowing that there was now a price on his head. Yet despite all he'd lost, he found himself laughing\u2014for here, in this tragic debacle, he had finally discovered a sense of satisfaction he'd been missing his whole life. He had upheld the law and defended the innocent in spite of government negligence and corruption. By working outside the legal system, he'd helped guide it back toward a righteous path. And he wanted more.</p>\n<p>Thus began a new chapter in Quinn's life. Roaming the nations of the Inner Sea, he constantly keeps an ear out for allegations of unjust accusations or abuses of power. When he finds one, he investigates the case himself, using a lifetime of association with law enforcement agents and detective agencies like The Sleepless to help him ferret out the truth. If the legal system seems fair, he often shows up unexpectedly at the court proceedings, presenting sworn evidence and acting as defending counsel for the accused. If he finds a court to be corrupt, he takes a more direct hand in protecting the innocent. While he respects the law, he also knows that people are imperfect, and that breaking local laws is sometimes necessary in order to uphold more universal ones. Of course, his meddling is rarely popular with the opposition, and so Quinn generally moves along as soon as he's seen justice done and taken steps to ensure that the victim won't suffer further abuses.</p>\n<p>Quinn is a genial, gentlemanly sort, quick with a joke and able to fit easily into both high society and low. His well-honed analytical mind is capable of astounding feats of logic and deduction, and he's fond of sharpening it still further with alchemical extracts learned from his parents and his own personal studies. While formidable in combat, he uses a sword cane so as not to unduly tip off his enemies to his abilities, believing that the best weapon is the one your foe never sees coming. He's loyal to his friends, and sometimes seems to have a connection in every town, yet is also wary of associating too long or too openly with his allies, knowing that his fight for justice has made him unpopular with various powerful factions.</p>\n<p>Though now well into middle age, Quinn has no intentions of slowing down. As he's fond of telling companions, \"a man needs only three things to change the world: a quick wit, a righteous heart, and a stylish coat.\"</p>",

While he respects the law, he also knows that people are imperfect, and that breaking local laws is sometimes necessary in order to uphold more universal ones. Of course, his meddling is rarely popular with the opposition, and so Quinn generally moves along as soon as he's seen justice done and taken steps to ensure that the victim won't suffer further abuses.</p>\n<p>Quinn is a genial, gentlemanly sort, quick with a joke and able to fit easily into both high society and low. His well-honed analytical mind is capable of astounding feats of logic and deduction, and he's fond of sharpening it still further with alchemical extracts learned from his parents and his own personal studies. While formidable in combat, he uses a sword cane so as not to unduly tip off his enemies to his abilities, believing that the best weapon is the one your foe never sees coming. He's loyal to his friends, and sometimes seems to have a connection in every town, yet is also wary of associating too long or too openly with his allies, knowing that his fight for justice has made him unpopular with various powerful factions.</p>\n<p>Though now well into middle age, Quinn has no intentions of slowing down. As he's fond of telling companions, \"a man needs only three things to change the world: a quick wit, a righteous heart, and a stylish coat.\"</p>",

            "name": "Samo (Level 1)",
            "backstory": "<p>\"Don't play near the water by yourself or the kushtaka will get you!\"</p><p>\"Don't wander into the trees by yourself or you'll be taken by the little-men-in-the-woods!\"</p><p>Samo had heard such warnings her entire life, repeated in fireside tales and stories told to pass the hours when her people left the summer fishing camps to travel to their inland lodges closer to Icemark's caribou herds for the winter. Samo was spirit-touched, born with the mark of the elk, an angel's golden eyes, and unusual insight. The cautionary stories always seemed to be directed at her, specifically, when it was her father's turn to tell the tales, as though her gifts would be more likely to lead her astray than the other children. Perhaps there was some merit to that worry.</p><p>It wasn't that she didn't believe the stories on that summer day when she crept down to the shoreline by herself. Her father and uncles had been gone for several weeks now, taking her grandmother to Seer's Home, where the elderly woman would live out the rest of her days among the Varki elders, now that her aged hips and back could no longer handle the nomadic migrations between fishing camps and hunting lodges. Samo wanted to be the first to greet her father on his return, and she was twelve years old now, nearly an adult by her reckoning, and she was accustomed to the little spirits warning her of dangers before others ever became aware of them.</p><p>Thus, it was particularly surprising when a cold, slimy paw wrapped in dank fur clutched her from behind, covering her mouth. Her screams were completely muffled, and all she could do was struggle in terror as she realized what had grabbed her: a kushtaka! Part man, part otter, the soulless creatures would drag her back to their village where they would cast her soul from her body and transform her into one of them! Worse yet, there were nearly twenty of the fearsome creatures quietly slipping from the waters around her. An entire kushtaka raiding party had come, doubtless here to take the encampment and disappear with them before anyone could so much as raise an alarm.</p><p>Despite all the terror she already felt, Samo discovered that things could still get worse. For every kushtaka that slipped from the waves, the insubstantial, sad-eyed form of a human walked beside them. Among the lost souls, she saw her father and uncles. Thrashing desperately, Samo thrust her small hand out towards her father's spirit, and the ghostly figure reached out to her in response. As their fingertips brushed, it felt like lightning struck.</p><p>The kushtaka holding Samo screamed in agony, the sound finally awakening the people in the nearby fishing camp. Her father's ghostly figure was nowhere to be seen, but the monster's body changed and contorted, its otter's fangs and fur falling away as its bones stretched to reveal her father's features.</p><p>Samo used the opportunity to run towards the camp, where she snatched up one of the nets laced with dog bone that had been left there to repel just such an incursion. Dashing towards the kushtaka, she saw the spirits of the lost Varki moving to aid her, and she swung the net about, pulling the spirits together with the soulless bodies that had once belonged to them, triggering transformations like the one that had happened with her father. The sounds and cries of battle finally drew the rest of the village to her side, and Varki men and women with spears and daggers did what they could to fend the remaining kushtaka away while herding as many as they could towards Samo and her net.</p><p>Though over half of the kushtaka escaped back into the waves, Samo managed to save her father, her uncles, and a handful of other Varki from neighboring encampments. As Samo's people gathered around, her father knelt down before her. \"You do not belong here anymore, beloved. Your gifts must be nurtured by those who understand them.\"</p><p>Samo joined her grandmother at Seer's Home and helped care for the Varki elders there while they taught her everything they knew of her people's legends, traditions, and magic. In her early twenties she had a brief, passionate love with a handsome young man named Nankou who also resided at Seer's Home for a time, but their duties called them apart more often than they drew them together.</p><p>Samo's ability to see what others could not made her into a healer and counselor, the person others called on when they suspected that unusual events were the doings of unquiet spirits. When fires raged, she spoke to the spirits of flame and calmed them. When people disappeared along the coastline, she would accompany the hunters who sought out the kushtaka villages hidden nearby, speaking to the apparitions that dwelt in the rivers and ocean waves to help guide them to those enclaves of lost souls.</p><p>It seemed to Samo that hardly any time at all had passed between that day on the beach where she returned her father and uncles from the kushtaka and the day when she looked into a small hand mirror and realized that many silver strands now danced amid the raven-wing black of her hair. Where had the days gone? Samo did not regret her service, but she envied the stories she heard of her old friend Nankou and his adventures slaying linnorms and rescuing would-be heroes.</p><p>One night, Samo sat amid the grove of Seer's Home. Her grandmother had passed almost twenty years before, but the woman's spirit still lingered in that peaceful grove, appearing to Samo's eyes as a majestic elk woven from the leaves and grasses of the grove itself. That evening, they conversed as they had so many times before, but unlike those previous occasions, their conversation was interrupted by a spectacular and terrifying sight.</p><p>Two great figures battled in the sky, gods of the southern lands. One, covered in armored spikes, was struck down, his body ripped asunder. As red and silver droplets rained from the sky, Samo's spiritual sight and physical sight crashed together.</p><p>As the god died above, she saw another battle: a powerful young man from a distant land fighting a fearsome demonic owl, until both were struck by the droplets of falling god-blood. The twined pair were spun a great distance through the air until Samo's spirit sight faded and she saw that they were both truly there, in the flesh, crashing to the ground on Icemark's shores.</p><p>A Calling thrummed within her. She knew this was a moment where all that she was and all that she had learned would be tested, when her choices and actions would determine not just the future of Icemark, but perhaps that of all the Inner Sea. Perhaps more.</p><p>She dashed to her home, and pulled on her well-used armor of bone, hide, and driftwood. She slid her clan hat down over her antlers, so that whoever she met would know that they faced a Varki woman of standing and power. Her grandmother's apparition flowed into her, filling her with the peaceful magic of healing and quiet places.</p><p>Moving swiftly towards the shoreline and the fallen figures, her grandmother's thoughts echoed her own. Let us go, the women thought. <em>This Calling is for us, this time is ours, and whatever may happen next, the world will know the power of the women of the north.</em></p>",

Samo was spirit-touched, born with the mark of the elk, an angel's golden eyes, and unusual insight. The cautionary stories always seemed to be directed at her, specifically, when it was her father's turn to tell the tales, as though her gifts would be more likely to lead her astray than the other children. Perhaps there was some merit to that worry.</p><p>It wasn't that she didn't believe the stories on that summer day when she crept down to the shoreline by herself. Her father and uncles had been gone for several weeks now, taking her grandmother to Seer's Home, where the elderly woman would live out the rest of her days among the Varki elders, now that her aged hips and back could no longer handle the nomadic migrations between fishing camps and hunting lodges. Samo wanted to be the first to greet her father on his return, and she was twelve years old now, nearly an adult by her reckoning, and she was accustomed to the little spirits warning her of dangers before others ever became aware of them.</p><p>Thus, it was particularly surprising when a cold, slimy paw wrapped in dank fur clutched her from behind, covering her mouth. Her screams were completely muffled, and all she could do was struggle in terror as she realized what had grabbed her: a kushtaka! Part man, part otter, the soulless creatures would drag her back to their village where they would cast her soul from her body and transform her into one of them! Worse yet, there were nearly twenty of the fearsome creatures quietly slipping from the waters around her. An entire kushtaka raiding party had come, doubtless here to take the encampment and disappear with them before anyone could so much as raise an alarm.</p><p>Despite all the terror she already felt, Samo discovered that things could still get worse. For every kushtaka that slipped from the waves, the insubstantial, sad-eyed form of a human walked beside them. Among the lost souls, she saw her father and uncles. Thrashing desperately, Samo thrust her small hand out towards her father's spirit, and the ghostly figure reached out to her in response. As their fingertips brushed, it felt like lightning struck.</p><p>The kushtaka holding Samo screamed in agony, the sound finally awakening the people in the nearby fishing camp. Her father's ghostly figure was nowhere to be seen, but the monster's body changed and contorted, its otter's fangs and fur falling away as its bones stretched to reveal her father's features.</p><p>Samo used the opportunity to run towards the camp, where she snatched up one of the nets laced with dog bone that had been left there to repel just such an incursion. Dashing towards the kushtaka, she saw the spirits of the lost Varki moving to aid her, and she swung the net about, pulling the spirits together with the soulless bodies that had once belonged to them, triggering transformations like the one that had happened with her father. The sounds and cries of battle finally drew the rest of the village to her side, and Varki men and women with spears and daggers did what they could to fend the remaining kushtaka away while herding as many as they could towards Samo and her net.</p><p>Though over half of the kushtaka escaped back into the waves, Samo managed to save her father, her uncles, and a handful of other Varki from neighboring encampments. As Samo's people gathered around, her father knelt down before her. \"You do not belong here anymore, beloved.

Where had the days gone? Samo did not regret her service, but she envied the stories she heard of her old friend Nankou and his adventures slaying linnorms and rescuing would-be heroes.</p><p>One night, Samo sat amid the grove of Seer's Home. Her grandmother had passed almost twenty years before, but the woman's spirit still lingered in that peaceful grove, appearing to Samo's eyes as a majestic elk woven from the leaves and grasses of the grove itself. That evening, they conversed as they had so many times before, but unlike those previous occasions, their conversation was interrupted by a spectacular and terrifying sight.</p><p>Two great figures battled in the sky, gods of the southern lands. One, covered in armored spikes, was struck down, his body ripped asunder. As red and silver droplets rained from the sky, Samo's spiritual sight and physical sight crashed together.</p><p>As the god died above, she saw another battle: a powerful young man from a distant land fighting a fearsome demonic owl, until both were struck by the droplets of falling god-blood. The twined pair were spun a great distance through the air until Samo's spirit sight faded and she saw that they were both truly there, in the flesh, crashing to the ground on Icemark's shores.</p><p>A Calling thrummed within her.

            "backstory": "<p>Although still viewed by many theologians and traditionalists as a newcomer to the world's faiths, Iomedae the Inheritor seems poised for greatness among the divine. Certainly her numerous orders of paladins have risen swiftly to take on the vaunted role of paragon in many societies. Evangelical in their exuberance to spread word of her wisdom, Iomedae's missionaries were pivotal in the defense during the fabled Siege of Solku. They sacrificed their lives saving the town from gnoll slavers, and although none of them survived the siege, their presence lived on. Particularly in the eyes of young Seelah.</p>\n<p>Seelah's family came to the walled town of Solku as pilgrims fleeing the atrocities of distant Geb to the distant south. Unfortunately, they traded one peril for another, and within months of their settling in Solku, the gnolls of White Canyon began their infamous pillaging. Seelah's parents were slain in the first of these raids, leaving her orphaned at the age of 14 in a strange town. She did what she must to survive on the city streets, pickpocketing and bullying and even hiring herself out as a mercenary. When a group of Iomedae's knights arrived to defend Solku, Seelah was immediately taken with their beautiful, shining armor, and within an hour she had stolen a particularly fine mithral helm with a golden bird upon its brow. Yet then, something strange happened\u2014Seelah became overwhelmed with guilt at her theft. For days, she agonized over the act, trying (and failing) several times to pawn the helm. During the Battle of Red Hail, Seelah realized that one of the bravest knights, a woman named Acemi with hair in long braids, fought the battle without her helm. This was the woman's undoing\u2014in holding Solku's gates, she took a mortal wound to the skull from a gnoll's flail. The woman's heroism carried the day, but that evening she died of her wound.</p>\n<p>Wracked with guilt, Seelah approached Acemi's body as her companions prepared for her pyre. They watched silently as Seelah placed the stolen helm over the dead woman's head, and then climbed onto the pyre aside her to join her in death. The paladins were moved beyond words\u2014they had known from the start that Seelah had stolen the helm, but Acemi had forbidden her brothers and sisters from collecting it, hoping that the helm would bring the desperate orphan enough money to survive for another few months. The knights of Iomedae took Seelah in that night. Although she has come to terms with Acemi's death, Seelah still regrets the theft that ironically brought her into Iomedae's arms. She originally came to Iomedae out of guilt, but in the past several years, that guilt has transformed into a powerful love and faith in the Inheritor.</p>\n<p>The young paladin wears her hair in Acemi's style and is trained in the use of the longsword. In so doing, she hopes to carry on the good work that Acemi might have done had she not fallen at the Battle of Red Hail. It's the least she feels she can do to make up for a death that she allowed to happen.</p>",

Unfortunately, they traded one peril for another, and within months of their settling in Solku, the gnolls of White Canyon began their infamous pillaging. Seelah's parents were slain in the first of these raids, leaving her orphaned at the age of 14 in a strange town. She did what she must to survive on the city streets, pickpocketing and bullying and even hiring herself out as a mercenary. When a group of Iomedae's knights arrived to defend Solku, Seelah was immediately taken with their beautiful, shining armor, and within an hour she had stolen a particularly fine mithral helm with a golden bird upon its brow. Yet then, something strange happened\u2014Seelah became overwhelmed with guilt at her theft. For days, she agonized over the act, trying (and failing) several times to pawn the helm. During the Battle of Red Hail, Seelah realized that one of the bravest knights, a woman named Acemi with hair in long braids, fought the battle without her helm.

Choose one deity.</p><h2>Skill</h2><p>You become trained in the divine skill listed for your deity. As normal, if you're already trained in that skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice.</p><h2>Anathema</h2><p>Champions care deeply about the edicts and anathema they take from their deity, sanctification, and cause. As with any implementation of edicts and anathema in the rules, these are a tool for roleplaying between you, the GM, and the other players at the table\u2014you're still playing a nuanced character, not strictly following a script.</p>\n<p>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.</p>\n<p>Similarly, using items, spells, or actions that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, assisting with a ritual that raises undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.</p>\n<p>If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your holy or unholy trait, your focus pool, and your blessing of the devoted. These abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an atone ritual. If your deity doesn't require the specific sanctification you had, your GM might let you retrain your sanctification and cause while still following the same deity.</p><h2>Sanctification</h2><p>Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you holy or unholy. This commits you to one side of a struggle over souls. Whether you become holy, unholy, or neither will limit your choice of causes, devotion spells, and feats.</p>\n<p>If you \"can be\" holy or unholy according to your deity's sanctification entry, you make that choice, and if you \"must be\" holy or unholy, you gain the trait automatically. If the deity lists \"none,\" you can choose only options that don't require the holy or unholy trait. If you are holy or unholy and gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you atone.</p>\n<p>Unholy sanctification for a champion can be extremely disruptive to a typical game and should be a player character option only in appropriate adventures or campaigns where the group collectively decides to embrace them. Unholy sanctification and causes are uncommon options.</p>\n<p><strong>Holy:</strong> You gain the holy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, \"Do not knowingly harm innocents or fail to prevent harm to an innocent if your direct intervention could save them\" and the anathema \"Commit murder.\" Even if your game includes behavior outside the Pathfinder baseline, the acts listed there are anathema to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Unholy:</strong> You gain the unholy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, \"Do not put another's needs before your own or those of your deity\" and the anathema \"Commit an entirely altruistic act, such as giving something away in charity\" and \"Put anyone's needs before those of your deity.\" None of these prevents you from performing acts others might consider helpful, but these acts must be done with the expectation that they ultimately further your own goals or those of your deity</p>"

            "name": "Valeros (Level 1)",
            "backstory": "<p>Valeros was born on a quiet farm in Andoran, where he grew up listening to the tales of traveling merchants soldiers and dreaming of adventure and exploration. Though this longing only increased as he grew older, so too did the demands of helping his aging parents run the farm, and slowly but surely the mounting responsibilities of agricultural life quashed any possibility of travel or seeing the world. Finally, just a month before a marriage of convenience to a local farmer's daughter could lock him into place (but not before he'd sampled a few of the joys of married life), Valeros came to the realization that the door to a storybook life of adventure was at last closing for good. Seized by a sudden, desperate need for a larger life than cattle and corn, Valeros packed quietly and left in the middle of the night with no more than a change of clothes, some pilfered food, and an old axe handle to discourage any ruffians who might seek to divest him of either. It was to become a theme that would follow him for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>In the years since, Valeros has come a long way from the wide-eyed young man who sought only the joy of exploration (and maybe a pretty, worldly girl or three to regale with his stories). Life on the road, it seems, is much harder than the bards' tales, and adult Valeros has the scars to prove it. Discovering himself to be a deft hand with a sword, Valeros quickly fell in with the rough-and-tumble mercenary crowd, there learning the dirtier, grittier facts of warfare. Though none could deny his prowess with a blade (or better yet, two), Valeros's association with various mercenary groups never seemed to last for long. There was his time as a guard for the Aspis Consortium, which ended when certain shipments kept coming in light under Valeros's watch (never mind that the exploited locals were dying for lack of grain, and only needed a little to make it through the winter). Then there was the stint as a freelance bounty hunter, during which Valeros discovered that it's a lot easier to hunt down escaped murderers than it is to haul in a young woman on the run from a loveless marriage. And of course, there was the infamous incident with the Band of the Mauler, to which Valeros will only say that he was positive their leader had been crushed under that cave-in, or else he never would have touched the man's wife.</p>\n<p>In the end, after acting as hired muscle for dozens of different employers, Valeros finally realized that the only way to keep from getting blamed for things which weren't his fault\u2014not really\u2014was to go into business for himself as an adventurer, traveling with those who properly appreciated him and letting those who didn't fall by the wayside. And if some of those companions happen to be pretty women, such as a certain Varisian sorcerer or elven rogue, all the better.</p>\n<p>While admittedly not the best at following orders, Valeros is an extremely talented two-blade fighter, easily earning his keep in any group through the tenacity and absolute fearlessness\u2014some might say thoughtlessness\u2014with which he flings himself into combat. Despite his reputation as a bruiser and scofflaw, Valeros has picked up a fair bit of education here and there during his travels, and can even read (something his \"respectable\" parents never learned to do). A worshiper of Cayden Cailean\u2014the only god who properly understands the need for freedom in the common man's existence\u2014Valeros takes an easy-come, easy-go approach to life, wealth, and relationships. Though a fan of fine weapons and creature comforts, the only object he's never without is the tankard on his belt (for you never know when someone might offer you a drink). Noble at heart, and fiercely loyal to those few who manage the considerable feat of establishing themselves in his affections, Valeros nevertheless hides such sentiments under a jaded and crass demeanor, frequently observing that there's nothing better than \"an evening of hard drinking and soft company.\"</p>",

Though this longing only increased as he grew older, so too did the demands of helping his aging parents run the farm, and slowly but surely the mounting responsibilities of agricultural life quashed any possibility of travel or seeing the world. Finally, just a month before a marriage of convenience to a local farmer's daughter could lock him into place (but not before he'd sampled a few of the joys of married life), Valeros came to the realization that the door to a storybook life of adventure was at last closing for good. Seized by a sudden, desperate need for a larger life than cattle and corn, Valeros packed quietly and left in the middle of the night with no more than a change of clothes, some pilfered food, and an old axe handle to discourage any ruffians who might seek to divest him of either. It was to become a theme that would follow him for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>In the years since, Valeros has come a long way from the wide-eyed young man who sought only the joy of exploration (and maybe a pretty, worldly girl or three to regale with his stories). Life on the road, it seems, is much harder than the bards' tales, and adult Valeros has the scars to prove it. Discovering himself to be a deft hand with a sword, Valeros quickly fell in with the rough-and-tumble mercenary crowd, there learning the dirtier, grittier facts of warfare. Though none could deny his prowess with a blade (or better yet, two), Valeros's association with various mercenary groups never seemed to last for long. There was his time as a guard for the Aspis Consortium, which ended when certain shipments kept coming in light under Valeros's watch (never mind that the exploited locals were dying for lack of grain, and only needed a little to make it through the winter). Then there was the stint as a freelance bounty hunter, during which Valeros discovered that it's a lot easier to hunt down escaped murderers than it is to haul in a young woman on the run from a loveless marriage. And of course, there was the infamous incident with the Band of the Mauler, to which Valeros will only say that he was positive their leader had been crushed under that cave-in, or else he never would have touched the man's wife.</p>\n<p>In the end, after acting as hired muscle for dozens of different employers, Valeros finally realized that the only way to keep from getting blamed for things which weren't his fault\u2014not really\u2014was to go into business for himself as an adventurer, traveling with those who properly appreciated him and letting those who didn't fall by the wayside. And if some of those companions happen to be pretty women, such as a certain Varisian sorcerer or elven rogue, all the better.</p>\n<p>While admittedly not the best at following orders, Valeros is an extremely talented two-blade fighter, easily earning his keep in any group through the tenacity and absolute fearlessness\u2014some might say thoughtlessness\u2014with which he flings himself into combat. Despite his reputation as a bruiser and scofflaw, Valeros has picked up a fair bit of education here and there during his travels, and can even read (something his \"respectable\" parents never learned to do). A worshiper of Cayden Cailean\u2014the only god who properly understands the need for freedom in the common man's existence\u2014Valeros takes an easy-come, easy-go approach to life, wealth, and relationships.
