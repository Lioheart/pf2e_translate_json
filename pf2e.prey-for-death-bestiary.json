They are outstanding scholars, with deep and nuanced understanding of religion, philosophy, astrology, and similar subjects. They take particular delight in exploiting the greed and hubris of gullible worshippers, using them to desecrate and destroy their own faith. Even in their goal of undermining the holy, nikaramsas' twisted humor knows few bounds, and they prefer to take on the guise of divine messengers with boons to share. Once they find a likely victim or set of victims, they use their vast knowledge of religion to impart contradictory wisdom, leading to the eventual implosion of the faith from heresies of the clergy and congregation themselves.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Asuras are, above all, proof that the gods are not infallible. These fiends arose as physical manifestations of divine accidents, taking form when the gods themselves stumbled and blasphemed on a cosmic scale. As a result of their own divine genesis, an asura loves above all to undo the workings of the divine. They eagerly travel to the Material Plane, seeking out temples, congregations of faithful worshippers, and religious orders of all stripes to sow doubt and destroy what the gods seek to build.</p>",

A keketar resembles a shimmering, serpentine creature with spines, claws, and a dragon-like head. A keketar's actual appearance is in constant flux, but they generally stay about 18 feet long with a weight of around 1,500 pounds. While their physical forms can vary, two things remain constant: first, a keketar's eyes are always a piercing shade of amber or violet. Second, the keketar's mark of office\u2014a crown of shifting symbols that hovers above their head\u2014never changes. A keketar cannot remove their crown but can suppress it, although most are loath to do so and consider such an act one of cowardice or shame.</p>\n<p>Keketars fill a role in protean society of a sort of priesthood, operating as intermediaries between the other proteans and the Speakers of the Depths. All other proteans defer to keketars, treating them in a way similar to how citizens of a mortal city would treat respected nobles; even more powerful proteans defer to the will of the keketars. As with many religions, dogma and theology are prone to interpretation and change, and among the proteans, the situation is even more pronounced. Whatever the nature and desires of the Speakers of the Depths may be, individual keketars often come to dramatically different conclusions as to their will and intent. To the proteans, however, this inherent dissonance is a strength rather than a weakness.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Guardians of disorder and natives of the primal plane of chaos known as the Maelstrom, proteans consider it their calling to spread bedlam and hasten entropic ends. The most powerful proteans are demigods known collectively as the protean lords, although they are mysterious entities whose cults in the Universe tend to be obscure and secretive.</p>\n<p>Proteans divide themselves into a loose caste system and possess a dizzying variety of powers. Most proteans have a serpentine body with the head of a primeval beast. Scholars have long been intrigued by this fact\u2014that scions of dissolution and disorder would share so many features\u2014pointing out that there is some semblance of order even in the purest chaos. Others note that the serpentine form is one of the most primeval shapes, perhaps suggesting that in a reality at the dawn of time, such shapes were all that could exist. The proteans themselves have little to say on the matter, which, perhaps ironically, only adds to the confusion and lack of consensus surrounding their kind. After all, if even chaos cannot be trusted to be chaotic, would that not be the purest form of entropy?</p>",

            "publicNotes": "<p>Bloody Hands was no agent of Gorum when he first rose from the polluted swamps of a remote fen in the Outer Rifts. For the first several millennia of his life, he fought for his own domain in the sprawling slime, eventually securing a realm the size of a small continent where his rule was unquestioned\u2014at least, until it was invaded by a host of Gorum's einherjar. Bloody Hands was taken aback at the aesirs' battle prowess, and he gloried in the fall of his empire to the extent that, by the end of the invasion, he was proudly fighting on their side, mercilessly destroying hordes of demons who had so recently served him out of fear. The einherjar admired his lust for battle but didn't quite know what to make of the frog-like demon, especially when he followed them back across the Maelstrom to Clashing Shore. After several centuries of brawling along the borders of that realm, growing increasingly less interested in sadism and more enthralled with the tactics of battle, Bloody Hands was granted permission by Gorum to become one of his servitors.</p>\n<p>Bloody Hands appears as a vaguely humanoid frog-like demon whose stance evokes that of a lumbering gorilla. His slimy green skin shifts to a bloody red along the length of his arms, so that his claws look as though they're constantly glistening with fresh blood. He has four beady eyes and a wide mouth filled with sharp teeth.</p><h2>Ex-demons</h2><p>Demons are known for their cruelty and wanton embrace of chaos and destruction, but now and then an individual demon encounters something that draws them away from their very nature. Such was the case with Bloody Hands, who discovered, through Gorum, that warfare in its purest form was of little interest to the concerns of demons.</p><h2>Servitor Of The Divine</h2><p>All deities maintain favored agents to work their will among mortals. Heralds are among the most well-known of these agents\u2014unique entities who serve as the deity's mouthpiece and messenger and are often sent in response to a mortal spellcaster requesting aid in the form of a planar servitor ritual. But a deity's herald isn't the only agent permitted to walk among worshippers or smite enemies of the faith. Those called servitors are unique, powerful, and stand among the deity's most devoted adherents.</p>\n<p>Servitors are quite powerful, yet they're not truly immortal. Any servitor of the divine may be slain in battle or through misadventure. In some cases, a slain servitor's body vanishes and is replaced by a powerful treasure. In others, the body itself simply crumples to the ground as a corpse. Servitors can be restored to life at a deity's whim, yet in many cases their deity won't immediately grant this resurrection and may simply seek to create or elevate an entirely different servitor. Should the unthinkable happen and a deity themselves perish, their existing servitors do not die but are immediately aware of the fact that their creator has ceased to be. Some myths tell of servitors who have then gone on to ascend in power and replace their creator as a demigod or even a deity themselves, while in other stories, a desperate servitor may seek out a new god or goddess to devote themselves to.</p>\n<p>While servitors are all unique creatures, in most cases they were once mortal worshippers\u2014be they humanoid or otherwise\u2014who have particularly pleased their deity. The resulting powers and abilities granted to the servitor vary wildly, but it's almost unheard of for a servitor of any deity to be less powerful than 15th level, or at least a few levels above what they possessed in their previous life. While there are not limits to the number of servitors a deity might keep, most gods traditionally keep no more than three.</p>\n<p>In Gorum's case, his three most well-known servitors are comprised of a demon, dragon, and an elemental, creatures who either embody the chaos of battle or the raw spirit of the forge. In each case, these unique servitors' worldview and philosophy closely match that of their Lord in Iron, leaving them outcasts or even pariahs among others of their kind. Yet to Bloody Hands, Saint Fang, and Temperbrand, there is no greater comfort in life than service to the god of war.</p>",

Frost rocs are nocturnal and tend to hunt nightly for a few weeks at a time, as the moon is waxing or waning full. They go into short periods of hibernation for the weeks on either side of a new moon, or during prolonged periods of cloud coverage, such as during a storm. They abandon these habits when they're trained to work as mounts or guardians\u2014something that giants or the church of Gorum often does in the remote reaches of the Lands of the Linnorm Kings or the Realm of the Mammoth Lords.</p><h2>Other Bestial Rocs</h2><p>Additional varieties of roc have evolved to adapt to remote, hostile environments and, like the frost roc, often possess some form of elemental magic.

Guards usually operate in pairs or small groups, but when a serious emergency threatens, guards muster at the nearest keep, watch station, or other rallying point and then move out in search of their quarry.Alternatively, guard troops might be stationed at important locations in the city, such as the front gates, the main prison, or the entrance to the ruler's castle.</p>\n<p>Individual guards may not be particularly well trained or experienced, but in large numbers they can defeat bandits, wild creatures that have slipped past the city gates, or the occasional drunken ogre. A group of city guards is usually accompanied and commanded by a single captain, who does most of the talking and gives individual guards their orders. The members of this city guard squadron have trained together to perform simple tactics but not advanced maneuvers.</p>",

A woman dressed in white fox furs greeted him, fed him, and tended to his frostbite. In time, they married and had 10 children, five of whom bore the legs and tails of foxes. These children stayed with their mother, while the other five-born with the legs and tails of wolves-traveled with their father back to the human lands and became the first adlets.</p>\n<p>Adlets aren't inherently evil, but their culture is warlike, xenophobic, and noticeably lacking in humility. They see themselves as the natural rulers of the arctic wastes and view everyone else as squatters at best and invaders at worst. A typical adlet is stronger and faster than any mundane human, with the ability to walk naked in a blizzard and call up ice-cold mists. Given that, it's little wonder that adlets have developed something of a superiority complex.

            "name": "Saint Fang",
            "publicNotes": "<p>This dragon is haughty and proud, often coming across as self-righteous. As the very embodiment of just wars, he feels he can't possibly be wrong. His polished steel scales make the distinctive sound of blade scraping against blade as he moves, and his needle-like spines clink against each other with every mighty flap of his broad wings. Saint Fang is war given a dragon's form, with the temperament of a master strategist.</p>\n<p>Of late, more and more of Gorum's followers have declared war for the sake of battle. They revel in causing bloodshed for any excuse, calling on Gorum's servants for aid, but Saint Fang doesn't answer those calls. He is more likely to appear for a group of villagers who band together to unseat a local bandit king or for a native population defending their homes against colonizers. He believes that war is inevitable as long as the greedy and bloodthirsty are given weapons, and he seeks to aid those whose justification for war is because they've run out of peaceful options.</p>\n<p>Saint Fang rarely takes a rider, but he obeys the commands of his Lord in Iron, Gorum. The god occasionally commands Saint Fang to take one of his faithful into battle, and he obeys him to the letter of his command, often unseating riders he finds unworthy once they reach the battlefield.</p><h2>Saint Fang's Past</h2><p>Many theological scholars on Golarion have sought the truth behind Saint Fang's origins. The most likely (and widely believed) explanation is that he once flew the skies above Golarion, looking to protect innocent mortals from the ravages of war, but became so jaded over time, that he eventually changed into a perfect weapon for Gorum.</p><h2>Servitor Of The Divine</h2><p>All deities maintain favored agents to work their will among mortals. Heralds are among the most well-known of these agents\u2014unique entities who serve as the deity's mouthpiece and messenger and are often sent in response to a mortal spellcaster requesting aid in the form of a planar servitor ritual. But a deity's herald isn't the only agent permitted to walk among worshippers or smite enemies of the faith. Those called servitors are unique, powerful, and stand among the deity's most devoted adherents.</p>\n<p>Servitors are quite powerful, yet they're not truly immortal. Any servitor of the divine may be slain in battle or through misadventure. In some cases, a slain servitor's body vanishes and is replaced by a powerful treasure. In others, the body itself simply crumples to the ground as a corpse. Servitors can be restored to life at a deity's whim, yet in many cases their deity won't immediately grant this resurrection and may simply seek to create or elevate an entirely different servitor. Should the unthinkable happen and a deity themselves perish, their existing servitors do not die but are immediately aware of the fact that their creator has ceased to be. Some myths tell of servitors who have then gone on to ascend in power and replace their creator as a demigod or even a deity themselves, while in other stories, a desperate servitor may seek out a new god or goddess to devote themselves to.</p>\n<p>While servitors are all unique creatures, in most cases they were once mortal worshippers\u2014be they humanoid or otherwise\u2014who have particularly pleased their deity. The resulting powers and abilities granted to the servitor vary wildly, but it's almost unheard of for a servitor of any deity to be less powerful than 15th level, or at least a few levels above what they possessed in their previous life. While there are not limits to the number of servitors a deity might keep, most gods traditionally keep no more than three.</p>\n<p>In Gorum's case, his three most well-known servitors are comprised of a demon, dragon, and an elemental, creatures who either embody the chaos of battle or the raw spirit of the forge. In each case, these unique servitors' worldview and philosophy closely match that of their Lord in Iron, leaving them outcasts or even pariahs among others of their kind. Yet to Bloody Hands, Saint Fang, and Temperbrand, there is no greater comfort in life than service to the god of war.</p>",

Though the bag can hold a great amount of material, an object still needs to be able to fit through the opening of the sack to be stored inside.</p>\n<p>If the bag is overloaded or broken, it ruptures and is ruined, causing the items inside to be lost forever. If it's turned inside out, the items inside spill out unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. A living creature placed inside the bag has enough air for 10 minutes before it begins to suffocate, and it can attempt to Escape against a DC of 13. An item inside the bag provides no benefits unless it's retrieved first. An item in the bag can't be detected by magic that detects only things on the same plane.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Capacity</strong> 100 Bulk</p>"

            "publicNotes": "<p>Temperbrand is a 14-foot-tall elemental with a shape reminiscent of a dwarf, but she appears to be made entirely from orange-and-white heated metal. Blades form and collapse on her skin, the metal folding over itself constantly as she moves and fights, but the swordlike lengths that replace her hands remain in place at all times. She fights with vicious gusto, slicing through foes as her limbs either transform into fiery blades or eject metal shrapnel from her body, propelled by pockets of steam and super-heated air. Temperbrand was created by Gorum as the embodiment of modern weapons and the potential of the forge to create any instrument of war.</p>\n<p>She is a merger of Forgeheart, a powerful fire elemental, and Slageater, a powerful metal elemental. Gorum had the two elementals fight side by side for 300 years before merging them into one entity.</p>\n<p>Temperbrand is often sent to bolster soldiers who are outmatched in an attempt to even the odds on the battlefield, making for a more spectacular war in Gorum's eyes. She might appear before a quartermaster and supply as many blades, shields, and suits of armor as they require, creating the armaments from her own body.</p><h2>Temperbrand's Corpse</h2><p>It hasn't happened yet to the powerful elemental, but if Temperbrand is slain, her body collapses swiftly in upon itself, transforming into a powerful magic maul. @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.596xrLHt1Sx0p7Pm]{Temperbrand}</p><h2>Servitor Of The Divine</h2><p>All deities maintain favored agents to work their will among mortals. Heralds are among the most well-known of these agents\u2014unique entities who serve as the deity's mouthpiece and messenger and are often sent in response to a mortal spellcaster requesting aid in the form of a planar servitor ritual. But a deity's herald isn't the only agent permitted to walk among worshippers or smite enemies of the faith. Those called servitors are unique, powerful, and stand among the deity's most devoted adherents.</p>\n<p>Servitors are quite powerful, yet they're not truly immortal. Any servitor of the divine may be slain in battle or through misadventure. In some cases, a slain servitor's body vanishes and is replaced by a powerful treasure. In others, the body itself simply crumples to the ground as a corpse. Servitors can be restored to life at a deity's whim, yet in many cases their deity won't immediately grant this resurrection and may simply seek to create or elevate an entirely different servitor. Should the unthinkable happen and a deity themselves perish, their existing servitors do not die but are immediately aware of the fact that their creator has ceased to be. Some myths tell of servitors who have then gone on to ascend in power and replace their creator as a demigod or even a deity themselves, while in other stories, a desperate servitor may seek out a new god or goddess to devote themselves to.</p>\n<p>While servitors are all unique creatures, in most cases they were once mortal worshippers\u2014be they humanoid or otherwise\u2014who have particularly pleased their deity. The resulting powers and abilities granted to the servitor vary wildly, but it's almost unheard of for a servitor of any deity to be less powerful than 15th level, or at least a few levels above what they possessed in their previous life. While there are not limits to the number of servitors a deity might keep, most gods traditionally keep no more than three.</p>\n<p>In Gorum's case, his three most well-known servitors are comprised of a demon, dragon, and an elemental, creatures who either embody the chaos of battle or the raw spirit of the forge. In each case, these unique servitors' worldview and philosophy closely match that of their Lord in Iron, leaving them outcasts or even pariahs among others of their kind. Yet to Bloody Hands, Saint Fang, and Temperbrand, there is no greater comfort in life than service to the god of war.</p>",
