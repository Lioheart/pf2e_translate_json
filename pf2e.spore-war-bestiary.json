Whatever forces call to the marsh giants sometimes ensnare boggards and ogres as well, gathering in grim worship.

This doesn't comfort goblins, of course, who have a particularly strong fear of harpies.</p>\n<p>Because their aeries often reek with the gore of their kills and careless spatters of guano, harpies carry a distinctly vile scent that canny travelers associate with danger.

These proud fey are obsessed with displays of respect, and while they first attempted to befriend mortals, each attempt ended in tragedy as the pukwudgies perceived any potential slight as a grave insult. Mortals, fearing these reactions, began to view pukwudgies as dangerous nuisances. Pukwudgies, in turn, began to resent mortals and the gods that favored them.</p>\n<p>At their best, pukwudgies play cruel jokes on mortals they encounter. At their worst, they've been known to kidnap and even kill those who don't treat them with proper respect. Violent fey like twigjacks and redcaps often gather under pukwudgie leadership, much to the pukwudgies' glee.</p>\n<p>Pukwudgies make their villages in the oldest forests, concealed under @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.HBJPsonQnWcC3qdX]{Mirage} spells. They travel freely between the Universe and the First World through tiny portals beneath hills, trees, or stones. No strangers to violence, pukwudgies rarely travel alone and often anoint their quills or weapons with a custom-brewed poison before entering hostile situations.</p>\n<p>Standing about 2 feet tall, a pukwudgie sports sharp quills growing from their head that extends down their back.

These succubi sought to slay a powerful witch who had befouled a profane temple the assassins served. The succubi failed at their mission, but from their corpses grew the first fungus tyrants. Pleased with this development, the witch then seeded numerous worlds on the Material Plane with fungus tyrant spores, who have since grown and thrived in their new environments as rot thrives in a corpse. Today, hundreds of fungus tyrants inhabit the fouler locales of the Material Plane. They're particularly fond of large cave systems and ruined cities, but also can be found in corrupted woodlands where blighted fey rule or in the sewers of active cities that spew vast amounts of magical waste.</p>\n<p>An encounter with a normally unintelligent plant monster acting with methodical intent can be evidence of a fungus tyrant's manipulations, but fungus tyrants are equally fond of keeping other types of creatures as pets and thralls\u2014particularly attractive humanoids. Especially favored minions are given the gift of the fungus tyrant's embrace and are transformed into fungoid minions forever loyal to their pallid ruler. Yet most fungus tyrants realize that a diverse array of guardians is best, and they often choose to keep some non-fungus minions on hand to protect their lair.</p>\n<p>Fungus tyrants are violently jealous. Any who attempt to lure away their dominated pets or cure those who have been infected by them earns their eternal ire. Yet it's succubi who enrage fungus tyrants the most. In these demons, the fungus tyrant sees a former glamour and power they no longer have access to, and only the brutal destruction of these mocking memories can salve a fungus tyrant's anger. A fungus tyrant faced with someone whom they suspect might be a succubus is terrible indeed, for in such battles, the fiendish fungal beings abandon their normal approach of subtle mental trickery and bring all of their power to bear in an attempt to rip the offending creature apart. Fungus tyrants also take great delight in transforming succubi into fungoid creatures under their control.</p>\n<p>While their jealousy doesn't compel them to do battle with other fungus tyrants, they're always careful to maintain their own territories apart from any nearby kin, and they take great pains not to \"poach\" other tyrant's charmed and infested pets.</p>\n<p>A fungus tyrant is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.</p><h2>Spore Thralls</h2><p>When a creature becomes a spore thrall, it rises from death with the same statistics it had in life, but gains the fungus trait, as well as immunity to death effects, disease, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.6uEgoh53GbXuHpTF]{Paralyzed}, and poison, and its alignment switches to match that of the fungus tyrant who created them. When a spore thrall is slain, its soul finally travels to the Boneyard for judgment, but the fungus-encrusted physical remains often spawn new fungal creatures, such as myceloids, violet fungi, or drakauthixes. These fungal spawn are not controlled by the fungus tyrant but generally regard them as an ally or, more often, a divinity.</p>",
