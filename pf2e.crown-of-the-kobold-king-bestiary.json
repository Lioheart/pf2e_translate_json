The traditional method of creating a mummy guardian is a laborious and sadistic process that begins well before the poor soul to be transformed is dead, during which the victim is ritualistically starved of nourishing food and instead fed strange spices, preservative agents, and toxins intended to quicken the desiccation of the flesh. The victim remains immobile but painfully aware during the final stages, where its now-useless entrails are extracted before it's shrouded in funerary wrappings and entombed within a necromantically ensorcelled sarcophagus to await intrusions in the potentially distant future. While it's certainly possible to use other methods to create a mummy guardian from an already-deceased body, those who seek to create these foul undead as their guardians in the afterlife often feel that such methods result in inferior undead-the pain and agony of death by mummification being an essential step in the process.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the method of their creation, mummy guardians are more than just physical shells of flesh and bone-they retain fragmented, distorted versions of their minds, with only enough memories of their living personality remaining to fuel their undead anger and jealousy of those who yet live. This burning rage only intensifies over the centuries of waiting within a crypt for the chance to actually act, and thus when most mummy guardians are awoken by tomb robbers or adventurers, they stop at nothing in pursuit of glorious slaughter.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While many cultures practice mummification of the dead for benign reasons, undead mummies are created through foul rituals, typically to provide eternally vigilant guardians.</p>",

            "publicNotes": "<p>These dark blue or black mollusk-like creatures have a similar appearance to an octopus, save that they have only six tentacles, all of which are connected by a thick leathery shroud. While darkmantle aren't a particularly good climber, they excel at clinging and can clutch onto a cave roof for days, patiently waiting to ambush any prey that walks below them with a disorienting blob of darkness. When clinging to a cave roof, and with their bulbous red eyes closed down to squints, darkmantles in ambush look similar to stalactites. Their preferred hunting method works best on creatures without darkvision, so they frequent ruins aboveground or shallow caves not far from the outside world. When darkmantles sense prey, they shed darkness down onto their prey before dropping away from the ceiling to flap quickly down to their victim, whereupon these beasts clutch and squeeze with their thick, muscular tentacles. Despite the shape of darkmantles, their bodies's texture is more like thick leather or even rubber-they can't cause damage with their spike-shaped bodies by dropping down onto other creatures.</p>\n<p>Darkmantles have a swift life cycle-their young grow to maturity in a matter of months, and most of these creatures die of old age after living for only a few years. As a result, generations of darkmantles quickly accrue, and over the years, they've developed a similarly rapid propensity to adapt to new locations. Aquatic caverns, for example, might be infested with darkmantles that can swim instead of fly; on the other hand, icy caverns would've led to darkmantles that developed white or pale blue colorations, and these specimens might produce blasts of obscuring fog instead of darkness. The deepest, darkest reaches of the Darklands are rumored to host darkmantles of incredible size, capable of smothering multiple human-sized victims simultaneously. These deep-dwelling darkmantles have the capacity to shed more powerful darkness that can plunge even creatures with darkvision into inky blackness- darkness in which these deep-dwelling creatures can, of course, still see well within.</p>"

Instead, gricks haul back fresh food back to their lair in a tight burrow or high on a cavern ledge, where they consume their spoils in small bites at the gricks' leisure.</p>\n<p>The origin of gricks is unknown. Even though these creatures have a rudimentary intelligence, they don't have any social structure to speak of. Most gricks are encountered alone. Even on those occasions when unfortunate travelers meet multiple gricks in small groups, those gricks don't appear to communicate or work together; each instead attacks an individual target and retreats with its prize as soon as it manages to bring down an opponent. Capable predators, gricks also have a strangely weapon-resistant hide that makes them especially dangerous to the unprepared. Many novice adventurers have fallen to grick attacks merely because they couldn't damage these creatures with their non-magical weapons. Those familiar with gricks (especially dwarves, morlocks, and xulgaths) know the best strategy for dealing with them when one lacks access to magic weapons is to fall back and wait for more powerful or magical reinforcements.</p>\n<p>Gricks rely on their dark coloration and ability to climb walls to keep them out of sight until they're ready to spring an ambush. On occasions, when food becomes scarce in a particular area, gricks have been known to travel to the surface and roam the wilderness in search of prey, but they make these sojourns almost always out of necessity, lasting only as long as it takes them to find entrances to new subterranean lairs. These creatures prefer darkness and the comfort of a ceiling overhead; they avoid the open sky and go to great lengths to keep the cover of trees, low clouds, or buildings between them and the empty gulf overhead.</p>\n<p>Some Darklands societies have tried to recruit gricks as guardians or even beasts of burden, but their intelligence-while middling at best-is more than enough for them to stubbornly resist and even resent attempts at \"training.\" The best most societies can manage is to keep a grick guardian happy by making sure it remains well-fed and comfortable.</p>"
