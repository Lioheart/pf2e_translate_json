Plus a +1 Status bonus is obsolete from level 1.</p></li><li><p>Using a similar line of reasoning, Kingdom Feats provide Circumstance Bonuses instead of Status Bonuses; if you want to use Status Bonuses, you can choose the Status Bonus variants (or V&amp;K alternatives)</p></li><li><p>Occult Shop ups the limit for Occult and not Magical items in your settlements</p></li><li><p>Worksites need to be in a claimed hex to be counted.</p></li></ul><h2>Vance &amp; Kerenshara Integration</h2><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NHksCXkXbjtrv-26VgFHNbyYldatVwag9lM44IWxIXo/edit?pli=1#heading=h.2bowazxvnvid\">Vance &amp; Kerenshara Homebrew</a> (and the subsequent <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CWQZMA5MZA8zDpG5QFWB-crF7j5LtfmV8nbRndOujg0/edit?tab=t.0\">1.1 addition</a>) adds a multitude of adjustments and fixes to Kingdom Building. The module allows you to opt into many changes in the <strong>Settings</strong> menu, except for the following:</p><ul><li><p>Renown will not be implemented (use a journal)</p></li><li><p>No changes to the turn structure is made; you are expected to simply reuse the existing structure and keep action cost in mind (2 actions for Retrain and checks with skills that you are not specialized in)</p></li><li><p>Similarly no visual help is provided for keeping track of available actions during the activity phase (3 for PCs, 2 for NPCs)</p></li><li><p>Additional Ruin &amp; Unrest buttons before re-rolls aren't implemented; I recommend to not run that variant rule, since your players will be decimated during the Cult of the Bloom events otherwise. Instead, I recommend to roll more kingdom events and throw more dangerous events at the kingdom, especially Troll Sightings events during Rivers Run Red</p></li></ul><h2>Official Adventure Integration</h2><ul><li><p>By default, the Kingdom Sheet uses data from the main hexmap scene if enabled; this means that claimed hexes, worksites and farmlands will be populated correctly from your hex map</p></li><li><p>Placing armies onto scenes that are owned by the players will automatically update update their consumption on the sheet</p></li><li><p><strong>There is no support for the buildings shipped with the official module since they don't cover many areas (infrastructure, V&amp;K &amp; home brew)! </strong>Instead, this module ships its own structures; those are automatically linked to the Foundry built-in token images and can be imported with a button during kingdom creation.</p></li></ul><h2>Kingdom Sheet</h2><p>The Kingdom sheet auto-calculates almost everything related to kingdom building. You launch it by clicking on the Fort icon on your Party actor folder.</p><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/img/kingdom/docs/party-controls.webp\" /><p>On first launch, it will create a blank kindom on the party actor. <strong>Make sure to give your players write access to the sheet</strong> by changing the party actor's permissions so that the players are the kingdom's owners. Then proceed with configuring the sheet:</p><ol><li><p>Fill in the details in the <strong>Kingdom</strong> tab under <strong>Creation</strong>. Leaders need to be drag and dropped from the actors sidebar and must be of type <strong>Character</strong> or <strong>NPC</strong>. If you are playing with the companion guide, make sure to set the appropriate invested bonus (or the leader type drop down when using V&amp;K Leadership Bonuses)</p></li><li><p>Next, Configure your <strong>Automatically Calculate Kingdom Resources</strong> setting in the <strong>Settings</strong> menu by deciding between <strong>Official Module</strong>, <strong>Tile Based</strong> or <strong>Manual</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Official Module</strong>: take worksites, farmlands and kingdom size from the official module's hex map</p></li><li><p><strong>Manual</strong>: allows you to manually configure these values in your <strong>Kingdom</strong> tab</p></li><li><p><strong>Tile Based</strong>: This setting sums up drawings/tiles configured on the <strong>Realm Scene</strong> (separate setting below) with meta information assigned by the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-kingmaker-tools.kingmaker-tools-macros.Macro.tsqRp4OXdkrzRajS]{Edit Realm Tile/Drawing} macro; claimed hex tiles/drawings placed on a configured scene increase your size, worksite and farmland tiles placed inside the claimed hex tiles/drawings increase their respective values. The example image below shows drawings that were made using the <strong>Draw Polygon</strong> tool and have a pattern background image configured. The Scene itself must be visible to your players:</p><ul><li><p>Edit the Scene configuration: in the <strong>Basics</strong> tab, change <strong>Permissions</strong> from <strong>GM Only</strong> to <strong>All Players</strong></p><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/img/kingdom/docs/tile-based.webp\" /></li></ul></li></ul></li></ol><p></p><p>Make sure to set the <strong>Active Settlement</strong> in the sidebar to the settlement the PCs are in or where the kingdom event to resolve takes place. At the end of the Kingdom Turn, hit the <strong>End Turn</strong> button. This will move all values in their <strong>Next</strong> columns to their <strong>Now</strong> ones.</p><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/img/kingdom/docs/kingdom-sheet.webp\" /><h2>Settlements</h2><p>Settlements are created as scenes on which you can place structure tokens. Before being able to use a settlement, you first need to add it to your <strong>Settlements</strong> in your kingdom sheet. You can decide between 2 methods:</p><ul><li><p><strong>New Settlement</strong> imports a default scene with block tiles.

When placing a structure onto a <strong>visible</strong> block tile, your settlement level will automatically be calculated for you. You can turn off automation on per settlement basis.</p><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/img/kingdom/docs/settlement.webp\" /><p>You can resize the tiles, change their background image, but you must not rotate them. Only rectangular shapes will work. The module ships a 1x4 and 4x1 tile at the same location as the 2x2 image that you can use to spice things ups. Also, creating these tiles manually won't work since they are only considered as block tiles if a special flag is set.</p><h2>Structures</h2><p>Structures are implemented as NPC stat blocks with their data being persisted on a flag. Their description is in the public notes. You will need to import all structures from the Structures compendium to make them show up in the Build Structure activity popup.</p><p>If you wish to create your own structures, you can use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-kingmaker-tools.kingmaker-tools-macros.Macro.DNVjHLroQKfN8y4V]{Edit Structure Rules} macro. Be aware that structure data is not stable and will change frequently, requiring manual migration on your behalf.

It will be excluded from all modifier calculations.</p><p>If you want to use V&amp;K's partial construction rules, first enable the <strong>Partial Structure Construction</strong> setting in your kingdom sheet. RP are tracked using actor HP and require you to set the RP value manually after constructing/repairing a building. Then, you can continue adding RP up to to either the structures maximum HP or the RP limit through the <strong>Under Construction</strong> tab in the structure browser. Once the HP value equals the structure's maximum HP, the structure is considered built. Note that this rule does not specify how it interacts with the Build Structure Failure result, so a structure can both miss RP and be Slowed at the same time.</p>"

                    "text": "<h2>Usage</h2><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/img/camping/docs/camping-activities.webp\" /><p>The basic idea of the sheet is to make camping incredibly fast by:</p><ul><li>keeping previous camp assignments &amp; meal choices</li><li>showing players and GMs if all activities have been performed</li><li>automatically managing Camping and Meal effects</li><li>automating resource management like rations and ingredients</li><li>allowing you to easily override degrees of successes</li></ul><p>Similarly to the kingdom sheet, the camping sheet can be accessed by clicking on the tent icon on your party actor. Make sure to give your players ownership permissions by right clicking the party actor and hitting <strong>Configure Ownership</strong>:</p><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/img/kingdom/docs/party-controls.webp\" /><h3>Adding Camping Actors</h3><p>To add actors to your camp, drag and drop them onto the actor list.</p><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/img/camping/tutorial/2.webp\" /><p>You can add the following actors:</p><ul><li><p>characters</p></li><li><p>npcs</p></li><li><p>vehicles</p></li><li><p>loot</p></li></ul><p>but only characters will be able to perform checks and consume meals. Because effect syncing is a very slow process, it is <strong>highly discouraged to add all companion actors to the sheet. </strong>Instead, enable their activities in the sheet's settings. The only companion activity that can't be enabled that way is <strong>Camp Management</strong> (because it requires a check). Simply add the companion for that specific activity if required.</p><p><strong>Important</strong>: Note, that users can't drag and drop their own actors from the sidebar by default, so the GM needs to pre-populate it.</p><p><strong>Important</strong>: If you want to run multiple camping sheets, each Character needs to be in exactly one of them. Weather and Combat Tracks are not bound to a sheet and are looked up from the currently active party's camping sheet (checked off in the Actor's Directory tab right next to the party).</p><h3>Hexploration and Time Tracking</h3><p>The sheet automatically calculates your hexploration activities based on the speed of your party actor. You can override the minimum speed by setting the <strong>Minimum Travel Speed</strong> in the sheet's settings (e.g. 40 to simulate horses).</p><p>Clicking the hex icon will advance or retract 1 Hexploration Activitiy. Remaining Hexploration Activities are shown in <strong>Hex. Activities</strong> and are calculated based on the time listed in <strong>Adventuring</strong>. Passing even a single second at the start of the day will therefore reduce your Hexploration activities as RAW.</p><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/img/camping/docs/time-tracker.webp\" /><h3>Party Token Movement Tracking</h3><p>Each camping sheet has support to automatically update the region based on where you move the party actor onto. There are 2 distinct implementations:</p><ul><li><p>An out of the box solution for the official module</p></li><li><p>A generic Foundry Region based one</p></li></ul><h4>Official Module</h4><p>This method is chosen automatically if you use the imported <strong>Stolen Lands</strong> map</p><p>Regions are matched by their name. Two methods are supported: the exact official region name or the <strong>Zone XX</strong> format that is populated out of the box due to licensing reasons. Example: <strong>Zone 01</strong> and <strong>Rostland Hinterlands</strong> will both map to the correct scene region. Make sure to check capitalization and exact spelling.</p><p>Region Based</p><p>The Region Based Method works by executing a provided function <strong>and does not work with the official module Stolen Lands scene</strong> . In order to set it up, you need to:</p><ul><li><p>Create a new Region using the Region Tool</p></li><li><p>Draw a Polygon or other shape</p></li><li><p>Then add a new Region Behavior named <strong>Execute Script</strong></p></li><li><p>Under <strong>Subscribed Events</strong> make sure to select <strong>Token Enters</strong></p></li><li><p>For the script itself, use <strong>game.pf2eKingmakerTools.scripts.updateCampingRegion(event, \"Zone 00\")</strong> where <strong>Zone 00</strong> is the exact name of your region (no extra spaces, upper and lower case letters must match!)</p></li></ul><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/img/camping/docs/update-camping-region.webp\" /><h3>Random Encounters</h3><p>Random encounters are managed at the very top by selecting the region drop down and changing the <strong>Encounter DC</strong> modifier if necessary. They are automatically rolled during rest but can be rolled during the day as well by clicking on the skull and dice button. If you don't want to perform a flat check hit the skull button instead.</p><p>Roll Tables are configured in the sheet's region configuration.</p><p>Keep in mind that the <strong>Encounter DC</strong> is not only modified by the encounter modifier, but also by chosen activities like <strong>Blend into the Night</strong>.</p><p>The rules mention that you increase the Encounter DC for each hour spent during camp and perform a random encounter check. This is widely regarded as a mistake and therefore isn't automated. If you wish to follow RAW, you need manually increase the modifier and check for encounters.</p><p>Out of the box, the official module only ships combat encounters. If you want to roll non combat encounters as well, you can use a <strong>Proxy Random Encounter Table</strong> which is configured in the sheet's settings. The proxy table can roll on subtables based on a formula or the configured roll table for the current region by setting <strong>Result Type</strong> to <strong>Text</strong> and <strong>Result Details</strong> to <strong>Creature</strong>.</p><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/img/camping/docs/proxy-table.webp\" /><h3>Prepare Campsite</h3><p>When you open up the sheet, the only activity that can be chosen is Prepare Campsite. Drag an actor from the actor list:</p><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/img/camping/docs/actor-list.webp\" /><p>onto the Prepare Campsite Tile:</p><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/img/camping/docs/prepare-campsite.webp\" /><p>To fill the activity. After rolling the check, a Failure, Success or Critical Success automatically advances the sheet to the <strong>Camping Activities</strong> section and syncs the effects. Otherwise clicking on the <strong>&gt;</strong> button will immediately move to the Eating section. Because no actor had the chance to cook a meal, all meal buttons will be disabled.</p><p>You can track existing campsites on a hex map by setting a <strong>Hexploration Scene</strong> in the sheet's settings. Make sure to set it to the Stolen Lands map if you are using the official module. This will save the current party token position and Prepare Campsite degree of success (other than Critical Failure) on the map. If you prepare campsite in the same hex again, you will be asked whether you want to reuse a previous result. The party actor token is determined by looking at all Characters added to a camping sheet. The first PF2E Party actor that the first Character is a member of will be chosen.</p><h3>Camping Activities</h3><p>In order to perform camping activities, you have to set <strong>Prepare Campsite</strong> to a result other than <strong>Critical Failure</strong> or <strong>-</strong>. Otherwise the <strong>&gt;</strong> button will jump straight to <strong>Eating</strong>.</p><p>To select camping activities, drag and drop your actor from the actor list onto an activity tile. Actors that do not fulfill the minimum proficiency requirements can't select the activity. You can disable this behavior in the settings.</p><p>Most of the existing activities are hidden and can be enabled in <strong>Activities</strong> in the sheet's settings.</p><p>After an activity result has been chosen, its effects are automatically applied to PCs. For this reason you want to complete actions like <strong>Tell Campfire Story</strong> before performing other activities. You can also quickly choose a different result. The previous effects will be removed if necessary, new ones will be applied immediately.</p><p>Some actions like Amiri's <strong>Enhance Weapons</strong> only apply to combat and can't be easily applied to PCs. The will be posted to chat if a random encounter happens during rest.</p><p>If you want to simulate companions taking their actions while in camp, you can enable their activities in the settings to prevent cluttering the activity section. Toggled activities will always be enabled and filtered from the activity selection section.</p><h3>Eating</h3><p>Each character in camp is available in the <strong>Eating</strong> section where you can choose their food for the day. To select a meal, simply drag and drop your actor from the top actor list onto a meal. It will remove the actor from whatever meal was chosen before.</p><p><strong>Favorite Meal</strong>s are configured in the sheet's settings menu. Only actors owned by each PC will be available for selection, but keep in mind that all actors listed in the popup will be updated on a save, potentially overriding saved values from other players. Ideally, no actor is owned by more than one character, but if that's the case, players will need to open the favorite meal popup one after another.</p><p><strong>Subsist</strong> is automated as a Macro: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-kingmaker-tools.kingmaker-tools-macros.Macro.0NhBWcZQf1GHp73f]{Subsist: Provisions} which will add an item called \"Provisions\" to your inventory. Those items are consumed before Rations and are removed after Resting.</p><p>Spells like @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Mt6ZzkVX8Q4xigFq] or other features that create rations can be handled by running the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-kingmaker-tools.kingmaker-tools-macros.Macro.7MrkVVB6D6UrdtA1] Macro. This macro adds a set number of <strong>Provisions</strong> to the party actor. If you want to automate this, you can set a minimum subsistence in the settings which is added after resting.</p><p>If a PC has chosen the <strong>Cook Meal</strong> activity and <strong>Prepare Campsite</strong> wasn't a Critical Failure, you will be able to perform the check by clicking on the roll button; otherwise the form elements are disabled. Rolling a check will automatically fill in the degree of success and post the buttons to consume ingredients and apply effects to chat. Contrary to camping activities, meal effects are not automatically synced to PCs, because they persist beyond your camping session and because they can stack. For example: you could suffer the Critical Failure from <strong>Discover Special Meal</strong> and then consume a <strong>Basic Meal</strong>.</p><p>The total amount of all carried ingredients and the total amount of consumed ingredients for uncooked recipes (recipes without a result) is listed to the right. There is no automation in place to prevent you from consuming more ingredients than you carry.</p><h3>Resting</h3><p>Rest duration is affected by the following parameters:</p><ul><li>Number of all actors in camp that are enabled in the watch rest settings, plus</li><li><strong>Increase actors keeping watch</strong> rest setting, plus</li><li>1 if <strong>Organize Watch</strong> was a Critical Success, plus</li><li><strong>Fish-on-a-Stick</strong> rest duration effects</li><li><strong>Guns To Clean</strong> setting (affects Daily Preparations)</li></ul><p>You can start a rest by hitting the <strong>Begin Rest</strong> button.</p><p>If you've set a playlist it will be played. If you want to play it only once, then set the <strong>Playback Mode</strong> to <strong>Soundboard Only</strong>.</p><p>By default, one random encounter will be rolled automatically during rest. This can be changed to one every 4 hours (RAW) or none in the sheet's settings. If an encounter occurs, a random point in time between now and the end of the rest will be chosen and time will automatically advance to that point in time. Afterward, a random camping character who is not marked to <strong>Skip Watch</strong> in the sheet's settings will prompt you for a secret Perception check. All companion activities that impose effects on enemies or allies will be published to chat</p><p>Once you finish the random encounter, you can continue the rest by pressing <strong>Continue</strong>. No more random encounters will happen. Time will advance to after your daily preparations.</p><p>Then the following things happen:</p><ul><li>All camping effects will be removed</li><li>All meal effects that expire after resting will be removed</li><li>All damaging or healing meal effects will be rolled and, if possible, applied automatically</li><li>The <strong>Rest for the Night</strong> macro will be executed for all actors in the sidebar</li><li>Additional healing received from <strong>Basic Meal</strong> and <strong>Healers's Blessing</strong> will be applied as will <strong>Shepherd's Pie</strong>'s halving on a critical failure. Doubling and halving healing will cancel out, regardless of how many effects would apply.</li><li>All <strong>Provisions</strong> items will be removed</li><li>All camping activity results are reset to <strong>-</strong></li><li>The <strong>Adventuring</strong> tracker will be reset</li><li>Hexploration activities will be reset</li><li>Travel duration will be reset</li></ul><h2>Fatigue</h2><p>Fatigue distinguishes between 2 modes:</p><ul><li><p>Traveling</p></li><li><p>Advancing time</p></li></ul><p>To travel, use the travel button on the camping sheet. This will advance 1 hexploration activity and mark down 1 hexploration activity worth of travel time. Once you go over the maximum allotted time for travel (8 hours or 4 hours if your current weather is either rainy, snowy or cold), all characters will become fatigued.</p><p>If you simply advance time, the fatigued condition will be applied after 16 hours. This can be extended by consuming various meals such as Fish-on-a-Stick, Ragout, or Cheese Crostata.</p><p>Note, that the Fatigued condition can never be removed automatically unless you rest, since the original source of the condition is not known.</p><h2>Automation Notes</h2><p>Meal effects and consumables such as rations are tracked by their name, so <strong>if you rename Rations, ingredients or effects, tracking will be broken</strong>. Compared to RAW, the following rules are not automated:</p><h3>General</h3><ul><li>The encounter DC modifier is not being increased/decreased/reset automatically. Many people have issues with frequency and likelihood of random encounter checks, so we leave this up to the GM.</li><li>For a similar reason, time is not advanced automatically when performing camping activities</li><li>The rules mention that each PC can take exploration actions as desired during Prepare Campsite and Camping Activities. Since these are GM fiat, they aren't implemented on the sheet. Simply open the character sheet and roll the checks manually, choosing the appropriate modifiers</li></ul><h3>Camping Activities</h3><ul><li><strong>Camp Management</strong>: There is no concept of sequential activities</li><li><strong>Cook</strong>: RAW, each meal is prepared by a separate cook and ingredients are expended before rolling the check. Currently, only one cook is supported who cooks all of the meals after camping activities are done</li><li><strong>Relax</strong>: Depends on sequential activities and, since this action can be taken by everyone and depends on the order, only a <strong>Relaxed</strong> camping effect is available in the Camping Effects compendium. If you wish to, you can create a custom activity for each PC and give it the Effect UUIDs of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-kingmaker-tools.kingmaker-tools-camping-effects.Item.QvR2yvuIVQuztCwQ]{Relaxed}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-kingmaker-tools.kingmaker-tools-camping-effects.Item.zliIP2agG0TVwKV4]{Relaxed (+1 to next campig check)} and Effect Target <strong>Self</strong> which handles all of the automation</li><li><strong>Provide Aid</strong>: Roll this one as a separate check from your character sheet and apply the circumstance bonus for the roll separately</li><li><strong>Exploration Activities</strong>: Activities that can be taken by more than one PC such as Exploration Activities are not supported since they require a different way of tracking time and have no clear way of automating them. You can execute these directly from your PC's sheet instead</li></ul><h3>Eating</h3><ul><li>Starvation &amp; Thirst are not tracked</li></ul><h3>Meals</h3><ul><li><p>All meals are automated as much as possible but you will need to manually take care of:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Reducing Conditions</strong>: Can not be done automatically because it is not 100% clear whether you are even allowed to reduce a condition. For instance Encumbered adds the Clumsy 1 condition but reducing it after consuming a meal is almost certainly wrong. The same applies for Curses.</p></li><li><p><strong>Apply damage</strong>: There are no 2e system APIs that allow you to deal damage without a token</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The following traits are lacking from their effects because the 2e system does not support traits on effects. These are important for spells and items that remove conditions limited to these traits such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.SUKaxVZW2TlM8lu0]{Cleanse Affliction}:</p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><strong>Poison</strong>:</span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Baked Spider (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Broiled Tuskwater (Oysters Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Grilled Silver Eel (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Haggis (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Hearty Purple Soup (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Mastodon Steak (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Onion Soup (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Omelet (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Seasoned Wings And Thighs (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Smoked Trout And Hydra Pate (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Succulent Sausages (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Sweet Pancakes (Critical Failure)</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><strong>Curse</strong>:</span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Black Linnorm Stew: (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Supernatural Mince Pie: (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Rice-N-Nut Pudding: (Critical Failure)</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>"

The first matching predicate (first case value) returns the value (second case value). If no branch is matched, the default value is being returned</p></li></ul>"

Since I've been wanting to resolve licensing issues when combining CUP and AGPL content for quite a while now, this was a perfect opportunity to go OGL only.</p><p>This required me to scrub any mention of Paizo IP from the module, including the module name itself, which is now <strong>Kingdom Building, Camping &amp; Weather. </strong>This should also clear up confusion that I've seen many times about whether you need to the official or unofficial module<strong>.</strong></p><p>In almost all instances, functionality was kept intact by simply renaming offending content. However, there are 2 exceptions to this:</p><ul><li><p>I do not ship companion actor statblocks anymore that weren't previously included. This was more of a maintability issue since the core system changes frequently and automation is not automatically migrated most of the time. Also, the Remaster didn't help</p></li><li><p>The Kingdom Sheet lost automation for appointing companions as leaders. Previously, the sheet automatically toggled the invested checkbox and enabled their features and activities when they were placed in the correct slot. This required override toggles in the settings to undo automation. It was a choice between keeping the old system and renaming the companions (e.g. Cleric Companion 1, Cleric Companion 2) or streamlining it. Now, everything works the same: you need to manually toggle the invested checkbox and enable companion activities like every other disabled activity</p></li><li><p>The Camping Sheet no longer ships Influence/Discover activities for each companion due to similar issues. I don't think <strong>Influence Cleric 1</strong> would have been a paritularly useful thing.</p></li></ul><h3>Kingdom Sheet</h3><ul><li><p>There is no special automation for appointing compansions as leaders anymore. Instead, you whitelist their activities like all other activities under the <strong>Manage Activities</strong> button in the <strong>Turn</strong> tab. You will need to manually toggle the <strong>Invested</strong> checkbox. Some companions provide benefits that need to be enabled in the settings instead. You might need to enable/disable their companion activities or invested flags after upgrading</p></li><li><p>Some activities have been renamed (the temple and lily leadership activities) and might need to be manually disabled/enabled</p></li><li><p>Mentions of Paizo IP in Kingdom Events and Kingdom Activities have been removed or reworded</p></li></ul><h3>Camping Sheet</h3><ul><li><p>Region names are Paizo IP so you will need to configure all Region names manually in the camping region settings. If you have the official module enabled, Combat Tracks &amp; Roll Tables will be prefilled.</p></li><li><p>Some Recipes mentioned Paizo IP. Most of them have been simplified by simply removing the offending name. The following recipes were changed:</p><ul><li><p>Broiled Oysters</p></li><li><p>Supernatural Mince Pie</p></li><li><p>Ragout</p></li><li><p>Giant Scrambled Egg</p></li><li><p>Berry Pie</p></li><li><p>Oysters</p></li><li><p>Omelet</p></li></ul></li><li><p>All Influence and Discover activities have been removed. However, you can now configure a DC per Skill when adding custom camping activities, allowing you to fully stat out the entire array of Influence/Discover checks</p></li></ul><h3>Journal Entries</h3><ul><li><p>Many entries were removed since they were duplicated in the sheets anyways and removing Paizo IP was work intensive</p></li></ul><h2>Tokens</h2><ul><li><p>All GMG NPC mappings have been removed to prepare for the arrival of NPC Core. Imported actors should continue to work, but there will be no image when browsing the Compendium Browser</p></li></ul><h2>New Feature: Camping Sheet Overhaul</h2><ul><li><p>When a new camping sheet is created, it automatically makes all players owners of the sheet to avoid permission issues and displays a quickstart manual to get you going</p></li><li><p>The sheet now calculates Hexploration Activities and allows you to advance or retract a single activity. You can set a minimum speed in the sheet's settings to mimic travel using horses.</p></li><li><p>Camp locations can now be tracked on a hex map. Choose a Hexploration Scene in settings to enable it. The party token position on the map is persisted after Prepare Campsite and will ask you to reuse an existing camp (if one exists). This uses a naive implementation of simply checking token coordinates changing the hex grid will require you to clear existing positions.</p></li><li><p>You can now configure all regions, including their combat tracks and types. New terrain types like Urban and Dungeon have been added to allow you to use the sheet in non hexploration campaigns as well</p></li><li><p>You can now configure the climate in the module settings, allowing you to set custom weather for each month</p></li><li><p>Combat Tracks can now reference a track in addition to a playlists</p></li><li><p>All combat tracks are now configured solely in the Camping Sheet. You don't need to create tracks with special names anymore and existing region tracks are ignored.</p></li><li><p>Companion activities that don't require a check can now be toggled in the camping sheet.

Old kingdom and camping actors were not deleted automatically but are obsolete. The only thing you might need to set again are the leaders, but those couldn't be migrated in all cases (see Upgrading Notices for 3.0). When upgrading your kingdom sheet, stat automation is set to off, meaning all of your skill proficiencies, ruin thresholds and ability scores will be preserved as is and can be viewed in the <strong>Kingdom</strong> tab. <strong>If you turn on Automate Kingom Stats in your settings, those values will be ignored and only read from the new ability boosts and skill training features. </strong>You can migrate to the automated version by taking notes of these scores when stat automation is turned off. Or you can stay on manual.</p></li><li><p><strong>Regarding Macros</strong>: The <strong>old macros won't work anymore</strong> since kingdom and camping data can now be stored on multiple party actors. There are new macros which you can create by simply drag and dropping the tent and fortress icon from the Party actor (see image below) into your macro bar.</p></li><li><p><strong>A note on permissions</strong>: Since the Party actor by default configures players as Observers, players will not be able to change anything on the camping nor kingdom sheet. <strong>Make sure to give your players Owner permissions to the party actor!</strong></p><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/img/kingdom/docs/party-controls.webp\" /></li><li><p>Shipped Settlement Scenes had their maps removed due to licensing incompatibility issues with Dungeon Alchemist's commercial licensing clause. New scene images were contributed by community members and can be found in the <strong>Data/modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/img/settlements/backgrounds/</strong> folder (or <strong>modules/pf2e-kingmaker/assets/maps-settlements/maps/</strong> if you own the official module). You need to migrate existing scenes to the new background images once. Afterwards, a new <strong>New Settlement </strong>can now be used to create scenes with the appropriate background images automatically.</p></li></ul><h2>Features &amp; Fixes</h2><ul><li><p>Multiple Kingdom and Camping Sheets are now supported. Simply create a new party actor if you want to add a new sheet of either kind. There is one limitation though: when rolling weather, average party level needs to be calculated for the currently active camping sheet. In a similar fashion, combat tracks need access to the current region stored on the camping sheet. To solve this, you need to click <strong>Activate</strong> menu entry button on the Camping sheet. This designates the currently active camping sheet:</p><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/img/camping/docs/activate.webp\" /></li><li><p>All macros that act on party members such as reset and award hero points, award xp or exploration skill checks now prompt for a party if more than one are found</p></li><li><p>The Kingdom Sheet has been migrated to AppV2 and rewritten in Kotlin. The sheet can now automatically calculate Skill Trainings, Skill Increases, Ability Scores and Ruin Tresholds. Your sheet has been set to manual mode; you can turn on <strong>Automate Kingdom Stats</strong> in the settings to enable it.</p></li><li><p>The Kingdom Sheet includes a Kingdom Builder now which can be accessed in the <strong>Kingdom</strong> -&gt; <strong>Creation</strong> tab</p><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/img/kingdom/docs/quickstart-1.webp\" /></li><li><p>Army targeting for <strong>Train Army</strong> and <strong>Offensive Gambit</strong> has been replaced with simply selecting tokens on the screen</p></li><li><p><strong>Supernatural Solution</strong> now correctly rolls the check before knowing the result</p></li><li><p><strong>Kingdom Assurance</strong> feats now enable an Assurance checkbox in the roll dialog</p></li><li><p>Building Structures from Ruins has been moved to the Repairable tab which now correctly applies the +2 item bonus to repair a structure</p></li><li><p>You can now add custom Feats, Milestones, Heartlands, Governments and Charters</p></li><li><p>Realm Scenes (Tile based resource automation) are now configured in the <strong>Settings</strong> menu</p></li><li><p>Recruitable armies are now looked up in a folder configured in the <strong>Settings</strong> menu</p></li></ul>"
