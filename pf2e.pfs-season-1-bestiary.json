Stories of ogre gluttons being tricked into eating razor-edged shields or barrels filled with poisoned meat are common, but such tales are of little consolation to those who have been gobbled down whole by these ravenous giants. In addition to their sadistic table manners, ogre gluttons have a disturbing knack for coming up with violent \"games\" that are little more than drawn-out torments, yet those who somehow manage to beat a glutton at the rules of its own game can often enrage and frustrate the ogre enough that the resulting tantrum is more than enough distraction to afford a last-ditch escape from doom.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Ogres embody brutish, amoral violence and cruelty. Standing 10 feet tall and densely muscled, ogres are as strong as they are cruel. Ogres are sadists that enjoy remorseless murder, torture, degradation, and mutilation in all of its forms. Although they prefer to vent their violent urges on smaller humanoids-the smaller and more beautiful, the better-ogres promise a horrifying fate for anyone unlucky enough to fall within their meaty grasp. But for all their creativity in developing methods of violence, ogres often remain too dim-witted to realize that their playthings lack an ogre's robust fortitude and high pain tolerance, so most captives die far sooner than the ogres might prefer. Such a fate is perhaps preferable however, as those who survive too long as ogres' playthings suffer lasting mental scars from the horrifying abuse. A captive able to keep their wits can sometimes trick the brutes by promising treasure, meatier captives, or other crude amusements, taking advantage of an ogre's limited intellect to engineer opportunities to escape.</p>\n<p>Ogres are social creatures only in the most debased sense. They gather together in groups called families, though members are not always related by blood. Ogres practice incest regularly, believing that it makes for stronger familial bonds, and most ogres are misshapen or mutated from generations of inbreeding. The most powerful ogre in any family is the \"boss\"-usually the family's patriarch or matriarch-while other ogres in the family learn to obey or risk being brutalized by the boss's loyal kin. Ogres lair in caves, crumbling ruins, or dilapidated shacks close enough to humanoid settlements or animal trails to make raiding easy. These lairs are filthy and frequently contain all-too-recognizable evidence of their depravity.</p>"

As one might expect from its name, a reefclaw's oversized claws are powerful weapons with their vicelike grip and the ability to inject potent venom into unfortunate prey.</p>\n<p>While reefclaws can't speak, they are intelligent enough to understand the local language of humanoids near their hunting grounds. The creatures sometimes listen to conversations, either to gain intelligence on the best place to ambush aquatic or land-dwelling prey, or merely for entertainment value-reefclaws are particularly fond of listening to people with high-pitched voices. Reefclaws are usually solitary hunters, but small swarms of female reefclaws have been known to gather around a single male for mating purposes or together for the communal raising of their broods. In the latter case, the females will perform widespread hunts in order to bring back a large enough bounty to feed their young. Such hunting parties are extremely dangerous-they've been known to tip over small flshing boats and attack those who fall overboard.</p>\n<p>Once a reefclaw has decided upon a course of action, it follows through even if doing so spells its own end. More than one reefclaw survivor has said that the creature released its bone-crushing grasp only after its brains were leaking from its broken skull, and even then the reefclaw was able to perform a terrible last slash as part of its dying breath. During mating season, female reefclaws are often a little more pragmatic and release their prey before endangering themselves and their offspring.</p>\n<p>Despite their intelligence and the accompanying moral quandaries, reefclaws frequently find their way onto the dinner plates of land-dwelling hunters such as humans and hobgoblins. According to those who have a taste for reefclaw flesh, the meat is either delectably sweet or slightly tangy (in the case of warm-water reefclaws). Most civilized people who know of reefclaws' intellect find the act of eating them distasteful, but this does not dissuade unscrupulous nobles in coastal regions, for whom reefclaw meat is a delicacy well worth the expense. Likewise, fisherfolk whose focus is on the bottom line of their ledgers are more than willing to hunt the dangerous creatures-or, even better, hire out the task to naive adventurers.</p>"
