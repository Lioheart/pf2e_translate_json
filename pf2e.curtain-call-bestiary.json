In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers flee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together, they merge into a horrific form as an animate dream.</p>\n<p>Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these forms, animate dreams find their way out of the Dreamlands and into the waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.</p>\n<p>An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link to that individual's dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the victim finds it more and more difficult to remain awake. In the end, the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form of fear and are its preferred sustenance.</p>\n<p>An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular nightmares, but these lesser fears aren't as satisfying, often driving the animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an animate dream won't starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a specific nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.</p>",

Originally created by sekmin occultists as a potent weapon against Azlanti wizards, since the serpentfolk empire's collapse thousands of years ago, ockomlires have spread upward through the Darklands. They often lair in sewers or abandoned basements in urban areas, drawn to society's use (and waste) of magical energy.</p>\n<p>Ockomlires are quite intelligent but tend to have bland personalities. They're fond of verbalizing their observations and experiences, speaking in unsettling piping voices through three mouths; they have a curious penchant for referring to themselves in the third person. They've little interest in having personal names and tend to refer to those they encounter by ancestry instead of name as well.</p><h2>Ockomlire Apathy</h2><p>Because they exude feelings of hopelessness and despair as \"waste\" from their magical feeding, the ockomlire has become a creature of apathetic detachment. While this affords the ockomlire protection from emotion-based effects, those that do affect them tend to hit hard and actually cause mental anguish. There are thrilling legends of ockomlires laid low by a single bard whose gripping performance simply stirred up enough emotions within the normally distant creatures to cause them rip themselves apart from the inside.</p>",

Their long, pink tongues are covered with hundreds of tiny, razor-sharp bristles that allow them to rasp through flesh with unnerving ease, even before accounting for the effect of their acidic saliva.</p>\n<p>Rezzelkis are ferociously territorial and quick to attack anyone or anything they regard as intruding upon their territory. Yet they're also prone to strange gastronomic obsessions, and if someone can deduce a particular rezzelki's favorite food, it's possible to become the creature's ally by simply providing it regular access to its preferred meals. A specific rezzelki's favorite food is always a specific type of creature\u2014some even prefer to dine exclusively on the dry bodies of undead like mummies\u2014but most have a taste for a singular humanoid ancestry. Presented with a potential meal, the rezzelki moves quickly to smash its feast with its wide tail. Then it feeds upon the pulverized remains of the destroyed creature, slurping up battered flesh and powdered bones with a noisy gusto that has earned them a strange nickname in certain circles: \"deathlicker.\"</p><h2>Rezzelki Hunger</h2><p>While a rezzelki can subsist on any sort of pulverized creature's remains, they vastly prefer a specific type of creature and can sniff these potential meals out with alarming accuracy. If an encounter doesn't specify what a rezzelki's favorite foodstuff is, roll 1d6: 1\u2014human, 2\u2014dwarf, 3\u2014elf, 4\u2014kholo, 5\u2014desert giant, 6\u2014mummy.
