Other devils often view their Risk Aura as a hindrance, so they usually receive less important missions. They don't mind, for it gives them more time to meddle with mortals.</p><h2>Heavy Footsteps</h2><p>Even when appearing in a humanoid guise, a gambling devil's body remains extremely dense and heavy, often weighing more than 500 pounds. Old gamblers' yarns warn to watch the footsteps of fellow gamblers and be wary of those whose tread seems disproportionate to their size, though in truth, all but the most careless gambling devils know how to step lightly in their humanoid forms.</p>",

They are incarnations of all the malice people try to deny within themselves and instead wrongly ascribe to deadly predators of the wild. Their power and skill inspire fear, but also awe, and it is not unknown for some peoples to treat such a rakshasa as a guardian, if one to be treated with extreme caution.</p>\n<p>Despite their nature as brutal flesh-eaters, rajas are extremely eloquent and philosophical when they choose to be. This is simply another form of camouflage, one that allows them to blend into cities, much as their stripes allow them to fade into jungles, and it often lulls scholars and intellectuals into a false sense of security. While it is not in the nature of a raja-krodha to be a social schemer or a mastermind, it pleases them when others delude themselves into thinking they are.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Rakshasas are primordial, divine beings who serve as incarnations of all that is foul within creation, born the moment that the concepts of good and evil were first conceived. It is their divine purpose to exemplify the profane\u2014by murdering their own kin, eating the flesh of sapient beings, and performing thousands of other atrocities, they define these acts as obscene and taboo, so that mortals know these acts to be crimes in the eyes of the holy. It is a role they must play, in the same way that a stage play must have an actor to serve as the villain, a role that damned all rakshasas from the moment of their genesis.</p>\n<p>Most rakshasas enjoy their role, in the same way an actor enjoys delivering a masterful performance, yet there is an element of tragedy to their existence. They are fated to serve solely as foils to others, to corrupt the unworthy and fall to the heroic, never free to forge their own path. They are condemned to perform the most heinous of deeds, even if it rankles their sensibilities and conscience. To do otherwise is to defy their nature and their purpose: the greatest sin a rakshasa can perform.</p>",

            "publicNotes": "<p>An animate dream coalesces from centuries of stray fragments of reverie and dream left behind as slumbering minds drift through the Dimension of Dreams. In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers flee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together, they merge into a horrific form as an animate dream.</p>\n<p>Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these forms, animate dreams find their way out of the Dreamlands and into the waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.</p>\n<p>An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link to that individual's dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the victim finds it more and more difficult to remain awake. In the end, the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form of fear and are its preferred sustenance.</p>\n<p>An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular nightmares, but these lesser fears aren't as satisfying, often driving the animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an animate dream won't starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a specific nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.</p>",

When Norgorber chooses someone to become a mask, a swift and nearly instantaneous blurring of the creature is the only indication of their change. Like most fiends, masks are immortal unless slain through violence or misadventure. Once slain, a mask's body decays as normal, and after a variable amount of time has passed, their soul returns to the Great Beyond to accrete its quintessence into Norgorber's realm of Duskfathom.</p>",

Yet they're also prone to strange gastronomic obsessions, and if someone can deduce a particular rezzelki's favorite food, it's possible to become the creature's ally by simply providing it regular access to its preferred meals. A specific rezzelki's favorite food is always a specific type of creature\u2014some even prefer to dine exclusively on the dry bodies of undead like mummies\u2014but most have a taste for a singular humanoid ancestry. Presented with a potential meal, the rezzelki moves quickly to smash its feast with its wide tail. Then it feeds upon the pulverized remains of the destroyed creature, slurping up battered flesh and powdered bones with a noisy gusto that has earned them a strange nickname in certain circles: \"deathlicker.\"</p><h2>Rezzelki Hunger</h2><p>While a rezzelki can subsist on any sort of pulverized creature's remains, they vastly prefer a specific type of creature and can sniff these potential meals out with alarming accuracy.

Most waxen effigies arise from botched rituals intended to migrate a powerful sapient creature's soul into a body made of wax, whether in a bid for immortality or a method of imprisonment or sacrifice. The death\u2014especially a traumatic death\u2014of a sapient creature in close proximity to a wax figure or while attempting to craft a construct out of wax might also result in a waxen effigy.</p>\n<p>A waxen effigy looks like a partially melted wax version of who it appeared as in life. They retain little of their former personality but recall a jumble of memories from their mortal existence that serves only to anger them. They often cling to objects that were important to them in life, such as a spouse's wedding band or a tool from a favorite hobby. Displaying such an object to a waxen effigy transfixes their attention, though they often lash out if the object is taken away before they can be laid to rest.</p><h2>Cruel Creations</h2><p>Few set out to create a waxen effigy on purpose, as their fragmented memories cause them to behave rather erratically, and as such, they make poor guardians or assassins. Any intentional creation of a waxen effigy is solely an act of spite since it condemns the soul to an undeath steeped in bewilderment and fear.</p>",

Their faces are often shrouded by a veil, mask, or webbing to both hide their identity and as a gesture of peace, for a zimiezek's bite can turn other humanoids into them.</p>\n<p>Unlike the karumzeks, Norgorber's more common divine servitors, zimiezeks almost never leave Duskfathom. Most are average citizens who revere Norgorber as both deity and prince. Only a few serve the god of secrets directly as the city's security and elite strike force.</p><h2>Uncertain Origins</h2><p>The zimiezeks believe the first of them arose from souls who were once Norgorber's allies in life who stumbled upon the god's greatest secret and were slain to conceal his identity. Some doubt this claim, given Norgorber's anathema on showing mercy. Nevertheless, a connection exists between Norgorber and both zimiezeks and karumzeks that lets the god automatically know the creatures' names and identities.</p>",
