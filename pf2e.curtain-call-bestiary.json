            "publicNotes": "<p>An animate dream coalesces from centuries of stray fragments of reverie and dream left behind as slumbering minds drift through the Dimension of Dreams. In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers flee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together, they merge into a horrific form as an animate dream.</p>\n<p>Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these forms, animate dreams find their way out of the Dreamlands and into the waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.</p>\n<p>An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link to that individual's dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the victim finds it more and more difficult to remain awake. In the end, the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form of fear and are its preferred sustenance.</p>\n<p>An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular nightmares, but these lesser fears aren't as satisfying, often driving the animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an animate dream won't starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a specific nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.</p>",

In this form, a kishi's powerful jaws are almost impossible to pry loose and can crush a victim's bones in a matter of moments.</p>\n<p>Kishi range widely in their physical features, and their height and weight vary as much as the people whose communities they infiltrate. They dress in fine clothing aligned with the latest fashion trends, and they wear flashy jewelry with the intention of drawing onlookers' eyes.</p>\n<p>Like most fey, a kishi has inscrutable motives, though to their victims, the kishi's goal seems simple-to revel in the expression of shock, betrayal, and terror on a victim's face. Although kishis can cast charm to make unwitting companions complacent, most of these sinister creatures prefer to trick their prey using guile, gifts, and their dashing good looks. These ultimate sadists derive pleasure from the thrill of the hunt as well as the delicious reward at the end. The more uptight, prudish, or haughty a target, the better-for nothing satisfies kishis as much as earning (and destroying) the trust of someone who rarely grants it.</p>\n<p>When kishis get their new friends or lovers alone, they choose the most dramatic moments to reveal their true monstrous forms and clamp their jaws down on their victim. Kishis have no desire to share their true nature with the entire community, so they typically aim for the throats of their victims, who can no longer cry out for help after being cut off from air. Kishis consume every part of their victims' bodies, leaving no trace of the crime-even lapping up any spilled blood, claiming the victim's treasures as their own, and cleaning the murder scene as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Few things can bind a community together as swiftly as uncovering a kishi.

Their soft, dappled brown fur helps them hide in forest canopies, and they have shimmering insectile wings and big eyes that draw in the faintest beams of light. At first glance, a skull peeler looks like a cuddly pet or a wizard's familiar. Any illusions of domesticating such a beast are quickly dismissed upon seeing how a skull peeler eats, however.</p>\n<p>Skull peelers have evolved to hang motionlessly in treetop canopies as they wait until appropriate prey appears, usually long-necked dinosaurs but also brachiating primates and large birds. The skull peeler then lashes out with its long tongue, severing the creature's head from its body and pulling the detached cranium back into its hungry paws. It then uses its claws to crack open the cranial cavity-hence its name-before lapping up the tasty insides.</p>\n<p>Despite skull peelers' gruesome eating habits, some enterprises and individuals can't resist the urge to add these beasts to their menageries. Fey and other creatures with ties to the First World, such as gnomes, can occasionally coax a skull peeler into a form of domestication. While the adorable beasts can never be fully tamed due to their hyper-evolved hunting instincts, they can be bribed with food and, if kept satiated, displayed on a perch or indoor terrarium as an example of their master's cunning and deadliness. As often as not, these pseudo-domesticated skull peelers end up devouring a guest, pet, or their would-be owner, but this possibility doesn't stop up-and-coming crime lords from attempting to domesticate the little predators. Skull peelers kept in well-managed zoos fare somewhat better, but these clever creatures don't always stay in their cages, which has led to wild skull peelers in places travelers might not expect.</p>",

Three feet tall at the shoulder and five feet long, rezzelkis are squat, mammalian quadrupeds with tawny red fur, with crystal-studded flat tails, and prehensile anteater-like snouts. Their long, pink tongues are covered with hundreds of tiny, razor-sharp bristles that allow them to rasp through flesh with unnerving ease, even before accounting for the effect of their acidic saliva.</p>\n<p>Rezzelkis are ferociously territorial and quick to attack anyone or anything they regard as intruding upon their territory. Yet they're also prone to strange gastronomic obsessions, and if someone can deduce a particular rezzelki's favorite food, it's possible to become the creature's ally by simply providing it regular access to its preferred meals. A specific rezzelki's favorite food is always a specific type of creature\u2014some even prefer to dine exclusively on the dry bodies of undead like mummies\u2014but most have a taste for a singular humanoid ancestry. Presented with a potential meal, the rezzelki moves quickly to smash its feast with its wide tail. Then it feeds upon the pulverized remains of the destroyed creature, slurping up battered flesh and powdered bones with a noisy gusto that has earned them a strange nickname in certain circles: \"deathlicker.\"</p><h2>Rezzelki Hunger</h2><p>While a rezzelki can subsist on any sort of pulverized creature's remains, they vastly prefer a specific type of creature and can sniff these potential meals out with alarming accuracy. If an encounter doesn't specify what a rezzelki's favorite foodstuff is, roll 1d6: 1\u2014human, 2\u2014dwarf, 3\u2014elf, 4\u2014kholo, 5\u2014desert giant, 6\u2014mummy.

Of course, this attention can be a double-edged sword. If a captain fails to appease the ship's allied shanty chanters (generally by giving them a fair share of the plunder gained while they're on board), the affronted fey afflicts the captain with a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.z2mfh3oPnfYqXflY]{Mariner's Curse} before departing for more prosperous shores.</p><h2>Chanter Vanity</h2><p>Shanty chanters are quite vain, adorning themselves in jewelry obtained in the raids of their allied ships or taken in raids of their own.
