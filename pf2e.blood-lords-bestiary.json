Stone is often thought to be steadfast and unchanging, but, when viewed on a grander scale over vast periods of time, stone can transform into things as diverse as intricate crystals and fine powder. To the aeolaeka, anything that could become either sand or diamond is the very incarnation of the chaos of reality-just on a slower scale. As a result of their stone affinity, aeolaekas are less capricious than other azatas, and some have willingly forged lasting accords or agreements with mortals. Stone-skinned aeolaekas are sometimes mistaken for statues and use this fact to hide in plain sight when they don't want their presence known.</p>",

When they burrow through the ground, only the fin of their thickly armored backs protrudes above-at least until they are ready to leap out and strike their prey. Their appearance, appetite, and iconic dorsal fin have earned the nickname \"landshark.\"</p>\n<p>A typical bulette claims a territory of approximately 500 square miles. When it finds an area rich in food, such as a farming village, it adds that area to its regular patrol route. Over the course of a few months, it can wipe entire settlements off the map. Bulettes are fiercely competitive creatures that battle relentlessly with other predators in their territory. They actively avoid contact or conflict with other members of their kind unless seeking a mate. Bulette pairs share territory and mate for life-a mated pair of bulettes being the only known exception to the creature's penchant for solitude. They rear their young for a short period of time. The mated pair instruct the young bulette how to hunt, teaching their spawn which creatures are easiest to kill and which creatures to avoid. The mated pair drive off their young after its first successful hunt.</p>\n<p>The first bulettes were magically created guardians, intended to serve as frightening pets for a power-hungry and sadistic wizard. The technique for their creation, as well as their original purpose, has since been lost to history, and multiple conflicting accounts of ancient texts exist with dozens of wizards claiming to have been the first inventor of the notorious beast. Some sages postulate that the original inventor may have been an elf-a theory born out of little more than the curious fact that bulettes, for all their ravenous nature, seem to find elf flesh unpalatable. Unfortunately for elves who stumble into a bulette's path, bulettes are no less likely to kill them than any other intruder, simply leaving the bodies unconsumed where they fall.</p>",

If no one exorcises the spirits haunting the bones, they become trapped and confused, their identities and memories intermingling. After several years, they can form cobblebone swarms, malevolent haunted amalgamations of brick and bone. These vengeful creatures conjure ghostly noises to lure victims down narrow alleys or into dark stone basements, where they pummel them to death and cover their remains beneath piles of bones and brick.</p>\n<p>Some have mistaken cobblebone swarms for cobbleswarms, but citizens of Graydirge know to look for nearby apparitions, or studded bones that move when you look away. These are sure signs of a cobblebone swarm, and an indication that one should take a different route to their destination.</p>\n<p>Cobblebone swarms look like piles of simple bricks or cobblestones with crooked bones embedded in them, often in the shape of crude faces.

Indeed, a huldra's regeneration is so similar to a troll's that a link between the two creatures seems entirely possible, but huldras despise trolls and resent tales suggesting any connection between them. Rather, huldras are wardens of the woodlands they occupy. Grown from saplings by powerful forest-dwelling fey as a response to humanoid encroachment, huldras protect and parley for the forest itself. Woodland creatures adore huldras, and sometimes approach humans or elves thinking they're huldras. This illusion is shattered if the animal sees the humanoid's back is made of flesh or that they're lacking a tail, at which point the animal recoils and runs away.</p>\n<p>Huldras respond well to travelers who show respect and deference for the forest, bestowing those they favor with supernatural luck and fortune. Those who scorn or attack a huldra, or those who mock their distinctive, bovine tails, find themselves plagued by poor decisions and even worse luck. Huldras commonly carry a bad reputation as sirens of the deep forest-cunning monsters who seek to lure woodcutters and unwary adventurers to uncertain ends. These stories largely come from miscreants foolish enough to have treated a huldra rudely and later complain about how they were unjustly persecuted. Even woodcutters and hunters can stay in the good graces of huldras provided they plant few trees to replace what they've taken and don't kill any creatures they don't eat.</p>\n<p>Though huldras choose to appear unassuming, the attention they put into disguising the supernatural parts of their bodies is sometimes lacking when it comes to their strength. They often perform feats of strength, like bending horseshoes straight or lifting heavy objects, without realizing they're breaking their carefully crafted facade.</p>",

A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless it is transported while it hides within its coffin, nor can it enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions-a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome its compulsion just as it does its revulsion.</li>\n<li><strong>Revulsion</strong> A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of its revulsion, it gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} condition, running from the object of its revulsion until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a vampire can attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:25|name:Overcome Revulsion] save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for [[/br 1d6 #rounds]]{1d6 rounds} (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li>\n<li><strong>Stake</strong> A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents it from healing above 0 HP, even in its coffin. Staking a vampire requires three actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious. If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if it's in its coffin the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.z9T4c1hXwOotsMCp]{Holy Water}</em> while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed.</li>\n<li><strong>Sunlight</strong> If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1}. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends its turn in sunlight. If the vampire loses all its actions in this way, it is destroyed.

A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless it is transported while it hides within its coffin, nor can it enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions-a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome its compulsion just as it does its revulsion.</li>\n<li><strong>Revulsion</strong> A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of its revulsion, it gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} condition, running from the object of its revulsion until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a vampire can attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:25|name:Overcome Revulsion] save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for [[/br 1d6 #rounds]]{1d6 rounds} (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li>\n<li><strong>Stake</strong> A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents it from healing above 0 HP, even in its coffin. Staking a vampire requires three actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious. If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if it's in its coffin the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.z9T4c1hXwOotsMCp]{Holy Water}</em> while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed.</li>\n<li><strong>Sunlight</strong> If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1}. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends its turn in sunlight. If the vampire loses all its actions in this way, it is destroyed.

After long years of research and the creation of a special container called a phylactery, a spellcaster takes the final step by imbibing a deadly concoction or casting dreadful incantations that transform them into a lich. While most undertake this drastic plan to continue their work or fulfill some long-term plan, others become liches because they fear death or to fulfill some malevolent purpose, such as long-sworn revenge. Regardless, the result is permanent and carries with it the potential to alter history-both that of those who transform themselves and of the countless mortals that will inevitably suffer as a result of a lich's new power.</p>\n<p>After its metamorphosis, a lich often finds some quiet place to dwell, typically protected by a variety of guardians and traps, for two primary purposes. First, a lich requires solitude in order to plan its elaborate schemes, and second, few mortals (if any) deign to interact with these legendarily corrupt necromancers. One reason begets the other, as the self-imposed isolation of a lich often drives the lich insane, further solidifying its separation from civilization. The longer a lich lives, the more meticulous a planner it becomes, secreting itself within a labyrinth of deadly puzzles, misdirection, and monsters. A lich's servants and guardians are absolutely loyal, either due to their nature (such as constructs or other undead) or as a result of compulsion using powerful magic. Many liches go mad, in time, and the nature of a lich's lair is a good indicator of the undead's current mental state.</p>\n<p>For all the protections it arrays around itself, a lich will go to greater lengths to guard its phylactery, as it knows that the destruction of this magical container spells doom for the lich. A lich is notoriously difficult to bargain with, though the threat of damaging its phylactery is a sure way to gain the upper hand in such a negotiation.</p>",

The traditional method of creating a mummy guardian is a laborious and sadistic process that begins well before the poor soul to be transformed is dead, during which the victim is ritualistically starved of nourishing food and instead fed strange spices, preservative agents, and toxins intended to quicken the desiccation of the flesh. The victim remains immobile but painfully aware during the final stages, where its now-useless entrails are extracted before it's shrouded in funerary wrappings and entombed within a necromantically ensorcelled sarcophagus to await intrusions in the potentially distant future. While it's certainly possible to use other methods to create a mummy guardian from an already-deceased body, those who seek to create these foul undead as their guardians in the afterlife often feel that such methods result in inferior undead-the pain and agony of death by mummification being an essential step in the process.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the method of their creation, mummy guardians are more than just physical shells of flesh and bone-they retain fragmented, distorted versions of their minds, with only enough memories of their living personality remaining to fuel their undead anger and jealousy of those who yet live. This burning rage only intensifies over the centuries of waiting within a crypt for the chance to actually act, and thus when most mummy guardians are awoken by tomb robbers or adventurers, they stop at nothing in pursuit of glorious slaughter.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While many cultures practice mummification of the dead for benign reasons, undead mummies are created through foul rituals, typically to provide eternally vigilant guardians.</p>",

A necromunculus may be loyal to its master, but it also seethes with hatred for all undead, including itself. If left to its own devices, a necromunculus immediately begins plotting to kill and gnaw upon any undead with whom it must regularly interact, even its master, even though it has no need to eat. A necromunculus cannot willingly act on this urge so long as it has some other command to obey, so their creators work hard to ensure that they are constantly supplied with tasks to keep them occupied.</p>\n<p>Despite their cannibalistic urges, necromunculi are gaining increased in popularity among Geb's undead necromancers.

Besides, they make excellent practice in espionage and logical thinking for would-be Blood Lords.</p>\n<p>Necromunculi resemble skeletal, impish humanoids with leathery wings.

Originally, shimmernewts were ordinary (if oversized) amphibians, living their lives between brackish coastal lakes or tidal pools and the steamy jungles nearby. Over time, the ambient chaotic energies flowing through Holomog magically altered their evolution. The shimmernewts of today barely resemble their ancestors.</p>\n<p>Their inherent chaotic nature has resulted in shimmernewts operating on different cycles from one another. Some are diurnal, some are nocturnal, but most are crepuscular. Shimmernewts that live close to peaceful humanoid settlements are often docile, but wild populations, whether deep in the jungle or in proximity to more violent settlements, can be quite aggressive. When provoked, all shimmernewts can inflate their gills in impressive displays to appear more attractive to mates or more intimidating to rivals. The capricious amphibians lack any natural predators, and conservation- minded locals are trying to prevent them from migrating further inland.</p>\n<p>Some underground rings host shimmernewt fights, an unsavory form of entertainment made alluring by lucrative betting. Strolling down the docks of any port town in Holomog for a few minutes provokes whispered invitations to these fights.

A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless it is transported while it hides within its coffin, nor can it enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions-a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome its compulsion just as it does its revulsion.</li>\n<li><strong>Revulsion</strong> A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of its revulsion, it gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} condition, running from the object of its revulsion until it ends an action beyond 10 feet.

On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for [[/br 1d6 #rounds]]{1d6 rounds} (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li>\n<li><strong>Stake</strong> A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents it from healing above 0 HP, even in its coffin. Staking a vampire requires three actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious. If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if it's in its coffin the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed.

The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends its turn in sunlight. If the vampire loses all its actions in this way, it is destroyed.
