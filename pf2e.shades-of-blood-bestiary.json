Chupacabras prefer to prey on the weak and slow, often hiding in wait and watching potential prey for long periods before attacking. Spry and stealthy, they most often make their homes in areas of high grass and protective rock, their slightly reflective scales allowing them to blend in well with such surroundings.</p>\n<p>Chupacabras prefer to eat lone travelers and farm animals (particularly goats) and leave little evidence of their presence apart from the grisly, blood-drained husks of their meals. Their tendency to stay out of sight combined with their naturally nocturnal activity often leads superstitious locals to conclude the worst, imagining that a particularly reckless vampire lives in the area.</p>\n<p>A typical chupacabra measures nearly 4 feet from its muzzle to the tip of its spiny tail, and it stands just under 3-1/2 feet tall. With their slight build and lightweight bones, most weigh close to 50 pounds. They mate rarely and only during the hottest months, with the females each producing a single egg that hatches into a tiny, dehydrated creature. The mother usually leaves helpless prey in her cave so the hatchling can immediately feed.</p>\n<p>Although chupacabras are typically solitary creatures, they have been known to form small gangs in bountiful areas. Members of these groups work well together, growing bold enough to attack larger animals, small herds, and otherwise more dangerous prey. Stories of chupacabras attacking travelers or laying siege to farmhouses typically stem from the hunting practices of such gangs. Regions where chupacabra activity like this is more common often have complex and colorful myths and tall tales about chupacabra capabilities or motive\u2014and a few of the claims, such as that some chupacabras can fly, are all too true.</p>",

The fiends come in many horrific forms, which usually manifest in twisted display of their vile predilections in life, ranging from the low-ranking augurs to the maestros of suffering and mutilation called eremites. The process of transformation warps the velstrac's soul step by step, with other velstracs conveying their new members through untold chambers of pain among the dark reaches of the Netherworld. The velstracs are led by the pinnacles of their kind, a group of nine powerful fiends known as velstrac demagogues.</p>\n<p>Once their transformation is complete, velstracs emerge as twisted artists who wield pain and despair like an instrument. They crave sensation, the more vile and horrifying, the better. They claim that this outlook is the one true path to perfection of the mind, body, and spirit, but in truth their administrations only deal out suffering and mutilation. Their corrupt attempts at perfection aren't limited to their victims, who they torture for as long as they possibly can until their bodies or minds fail, but also applied to themselves, testing their own resolve in a crucible of pain.</p>\n<p>Velstracs feature in this adventure in a couple of ways. When Nizca and Deg failed to veil the sun in shadows using the shadow beacon, portions of the Netherworld overlaid En-Gokal. The velstracs, led by the velstrac conductor Jubilant, passed traveled from their shadowy realm into the mortal world of the Universe. When they arrived, they were amused by the predations of the vampires and their tenacity to hold the ruined prison, but they were especially delighted by Nizca, with whom they felt a kinship in shadow due to Nizca being an ancient strigoi\u2014a perfect blend of shadow and vampire. Jubilant and their fellow velstracs obviously favored the plan to bring eternal darkness to Golarion, and thus they support Nizca in completing their horrifying mission, but who can say how long that support will last once the plan is complete?</p>\n<p>In addition to the most prevalent influence of velstracs in the Ebon Tower, they also play another role for the primary antagonist, Nizca. As mentioned in the campaign, one of Nizca's motivations for escaping En-Gokal is to reunite with their lover from the time before Earthfall. A cruel yet handsome man, Lograsi was a worshipper of Aroggus, a powerful velstrac demagogue with the portfolios of possibility, revenge, and sanctuary. This connection was part of Nizca's reason to trust in Jubilant and their group of velstracs, knowing that her distant lover was of the faith.</p><h2>Velstrac Conductor</h2><p>Conductors are velstracs who believe screams of anguish to be the ultimate form of musical expression. These sadistic musicians compose \"joyous symphonies\" from the agonized howling of their tortured, captive choirs.</p><h2>Instruments</h2><p>Conductors go to great lengths to acquire the finest instruments for their choirs, judging an individual singer's worth by their tone, emotion, endurance, and responsiveness. Vocalists who don't measure up to a conductor's standards are either played to death or passed on to other \"less discerning\" velstracs. Cherished instruments can expect to live a long, tortuous existence in a conductor's choir, receiving the best medical attention after each performance\u2014at least until their voice gives out.</p><h2>Tortured Friendships</h2><p>Velstrac conductors are fairly amiable among their kind and often work with other velstracs. They particularly get along well with ostiarius velstracs and velstrac evangelists, who they tend to boss around. Though they find sacristans piteous, they're intrigued by their Shadow Scream ability.</p>",

The veil of night, however, conceals a wide array of vampiric creatures. Neither wholly wolf nor bat, desmohunds, also called vampire hounds, use their limited flight to swiftly close the gap between themselves and fleeing prey. This rapid movement, along with a penchant for hunting in perfect darkness, is often the cause of a survivor's confusion when asked to describe just what it was that attacked them.</p>\n<p>As their common name suggests, vampire hounds share a strong affinity with vampires. While the hounds can subsist entirely on flesh, they have a particular taste for blood. A desmohund attack is brutal and violent. The creature tears their victim apart, allowing the blood to generously pool on the ground before lapping it up. Only after the blood is consumed do the beasts begin devouring flesh.</p>\n<p>Desmohunds are surprisingly loyal and often defend their masters to the death. Though they generally serve vampires, it isn't unheard of for the living to keep such creatures as pets, especially in areas like Ustalav, Nidal, and the Darklands, where they can sometimes be found prowling the grounds of foreboding estates.</p>\n<p>Vampire hunters carry a variety of tools to stalk and destroy their favored prey, but clever ones also carry items that can work against a vampire's allies too. Therefore, some carry bags of cinnamon or vials of eucalyptus oil to confuse and irritate desmohunds' keen sense of smell.</p><h2>Divine Origins</h2><p>Sources differ on the origin of desmohunds. Some legends state that Urgathoa created the first vampire hounds as pets to keep her company in undeath. Others claim that Nin distilled the best parts of vampires and wolves to create a nigh-unstoppable hunter. One story posits that Lamashtu created the first desmohunds, but Zura the Vampire Queen stole them from Lamashtu's realm of Kurnugia, claiming the creatures as her own. The only common thread among these tales is each god's insistence that they were the true creators of desmohunds, suggesting that there's an unknown reason the gods would vie for such a title.</p>",

At least, until the fulthrethu attacks, at which point its true appearance\u2014that of a manta-ray-like creature with a suckered tail, toothy maw, and a dozen orange eyes\u2014becomes clear.</p>\n<p>Alghollthus created the first fulthrethus eons ago to serve a unique role\u2014to beguile unsuspecting creatures via frighteningly realistic illusions. Typically, a fulthrethu infiltrates a community by securing a safe hiding place, such as a garbage dump or cistern, from which it sends forth an illusory member of that community to spy on and interact with the locals.</p>\n<p>Today, fulthrethus who escape their alghollthu creators often gather in small enclaves, but they're no less malevolent. Instead, the fulthrethus' goal of manipulating nearby communities simply becomes more self- serving. Members of a fulthrethu enclave often share the responsibility of maintaining the appearance of an illusory god, through which they reduce nearby villages into unsuspecting cults that supply the fulthrethus with all the food and treasure they desire.</p><h2>Fulthrethu Trickery</h2><p>Although a fulthrethu is skilled at deceiving others through its illusory proxies, it has no magical sensory link to its illusions. To maintain believable control over an illusion or to observe how others react to it, the fulthrethu must remain within range of its illusion (typically 500 feet). Concentrating on a lasting illusion and its flotsam disguise at the same time leaves the fulthrethu limited in the other actions it can take in a round.</p>",

The strongest or most violent ogre in a family (in most cases, this is the same ogre) is invariably that family's boss.

When an ogre boss barks out commands, the other members of the family move quickly to obey.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>For many societies, ogres embody brutish, amoral violence and greedy cruelty.

Although they prefer to vent their violent urges on other humanoids\u2014the smaller the better\u2014ogre captivity can end in a horrifying fate for anyone unlucky enough to fall within their meaty grasp: becoming dinner. But for all their creativity in inflicting pain, ogres often forget that their playthings lack their own robust fortitude and high pain tolerance, and many of their captives die sooner than the ogres might prefer. Meanwhile, those who manage to survive captivity in an ogre's larder often emerge with lasting mental scars. A captive able to keep their wits about them, however, can sometimes trick the brutes by promising treasure, more plentiful food sources, or other crude amusements, taking advantage of an ogre's often-limited intellect to engineer opportunities to escape or gain revenge.</p>\n<p>Ogres are social creatures only in the most debased sense.

The most powerful ogre in any family is the \"boss\"\u2014usually the family's patriarch or matriarch\u2014whom the other ogres in the family learn to quickly obey or risk being brutalized by the boss's loyal kin. Ogres lair in caves, crumbling ruins, or dilapidated shacks close enough to humanoid settlements or animal trails to make raiding easy.

The concept of gender is fluid to a succubus, as they can adopt countless humanoid forms of any gender to aid in their goals. Most succubi have a feminine true form (incubi, which usually have a masculine true form, are a different kind of demon), but regardless of gender, a lust demon is supernaturally beautiful or handsome, but with curving horns, bat wings, sharp claws, and a sinuous tail.</p>\n<p>When disguised as a mortal humanoid in the Universe, a succubus whispers into the ears of mortals, urging them to pursue their darkest and most destructive desires and pushing them into depravity, using magic only if persuasion fails. While mortals often fixate on succubi's application of sexual lust, these demons are can easily exploit lust for power, knowledge, fame, or any other desire as easily as more carnal appetites. Their ability to infiltrate societies makes them excellent spies, assassins, and political saboteurs as well. Ultimately, the succubus enjoys all means of upending mortal culture.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When a sinful mortal soul is judged and sent on to the Outer Rifts, it can become a deadly fiend\u2014a demon. Demons are living incarnations of sin\u2014be they classic sins like wrath or gluttony, or more \"specialized\" depravities like an obsession with torture or the act of treason or treachery. Once formed, a demon's driving goals are twofold\u2014the amassing of personal power, and the corruption of mortal souls to cause them to become tainted by sin. In this way demons ensure a never-ending supply of new demons to bolster their ever-growing ranks in the Outer Rifts.</p>\n<p>Demons are selfish and self-absorbed creatures, and most firmly believe that mortals only play at being more virtuous than fiends. They enjoy tempting mortals into damnation to both indulge their egos and swell their armies. Like many other fiends, one of the great rewards of this manipulation is fulfilling their hunger for souls. In their eyes, the primary use for these souls is to spawn new demons, who can serve as soldiers, slaves, pawns, or even currency for their more powerful masters.</p>",

A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless they're transported while they hide within their coffin, nor can they enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions\u2014a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome their compulsion just as they do their revulsion.</li><li><strong>Revulsion</strong> A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a deity with a holy sanctification option. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so, and it remains brandished for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they end an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of their revulsion, a vampire can attempt a @Check[will|dc:25] save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for [[/gmr 1d6 #rounds]]{1d6 rounds} (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li><li><strong>Stake</strong> A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents them from healing above 0 HP, even in their coffin. Staking a vampire requires 3 actions and works only if the vampire is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious}. If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if they're in their coffin, the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with holy water while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed.</li><li><strong>Sunlight</strong> If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1}. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends their turn in sunlight, and the condition ends when they're no longer in sunlight.

It appears to be dead: it doesn't breathe, its body temperature matches its surroundings, and it doesn't react to pain or other stimuli. A successful @Check[perception|against:reflex] check against the strigoi's Reflex DC is enough to note one anomaly: the shadow cast by its \"dead\" body shifts and moves slightly, its edges twisting and active. Spells like @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.QnTtGCAvdWRU4spv]{Detect Alignment}, senses like lifesense, and the \"corpse\" taking damage from vitality energy still function normally, and could reveal the truth without needing a successful Perception check.

Although they prefer to vent their violent urges on other humanoids\u2014the smaller the better\u2014ogre captivity can end in a horrifying fate for anyone unlucky enough to fall within their meaty grasp: becoming dinner. But for all their creativity in inflicting pain, ogres often forget that their playthings lack their own robust fortitude and high pain tolerance, and many of their captives die sooner than the ogres might prefer. Meanwhile, those who manage to survive captivity in an ogre's larder often emerge with lasting mental scars. A captive able to keep their wits about them, however, can sometimes trick the brutes by promising treasure, more plentiful food sources, or other crude amusements, taking advantage of an ogre's often-limited intellect to engineer opportunities to escape or gain revenge.</p>\n<p>Ogres are social creatures only in the most debased sense.

Only a strigoi's shadow reflects in a mirror, and this often compels them to cover or destroy mirrors in their presence rather than risk their true nature being displayed. A strigoi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or source of bright light. To brandish a mirror or light source, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the strigoi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or light source, it gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} condition, running from the brandished object until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a strigoi can attempt a @Check[will|dc:25] save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for [[/gmr 1d6 #Overcome Revulsions Duration]]{1d6 rounds} (or 1 hour on a critical success). A strigoi can move normally around mirrors or bright light sources that are not brandished, although doing so causes them discomfort that can be noticed with a successful Perception check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1xRFPTFtWtGJ9ELw]{Sense Motive}.</li>\n<li><strong>Sunlight</strong> When exposed to direct sunlight, a strigoi immediately becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious} and falls to the ground. It appears to be dead: it doesn't breathe, its body temperature matches its surroundings, and it doesn't react to pain or other stimuli. A successful @Check[perception|against:reflex] check against the strigoi's Reflex DC is enough to note one anomaly: the shadow cast by its \"dead\" body shifts and moves slightly, its edges twisting and active. Spells like @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.QnTtGCAvdWRU4spv]{Detect Alignment}, senses like lifesense, and the \"corpse\" taking damage from vitality energy still function normally, and could reveal the truth without needing a successful Perception check. Viewing the \"corpse\" in a mirror's reflection can also reveal the truth, for only the body's shadow reflects. While in sunlight and unconscious, the strigoi loses its resistance to physical damage. If the strigoi takes enough damage that it would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, its body quickly decomposes, and the strigoi is destroyed.</li>\n<li><strong>Water Revulsion</strong> A strigoi cannot cross a significant source of running water (such as a creek, river, or waves on a seashore). A strigoi capable of flight can cross running water provided it approaches no closer than 10 feet to the liquid's surface. If forced into running water against its will, the strigoi becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 2} and gains the fleeing condition as long as it remains in the water.

Only a strigoi's shadow reflects in a mirror, and this often compels them to cover or destroy mirrors in their presence rather than risk their true nature being displayed. A strigoi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or source of bright light. To brandish a mirror or light source, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the strigoi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or light source, it gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} condition, running from the brandished object until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a strigoi can attempt a @Check[will|dc:25] save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for [[/gmr 1d6 #Overcome Revulsions Duration]]{1d6 rounds} (or 1 hour on a critical success). A strigoi can move normally around mirrors or bright light sources that are not brandished, although doing so causes them discomfort that can be noticed with a successful Perception check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1xRFPTFtWtGJ9ELw]{Sense Motive}.</li>\n<li><strong>Sunlight</strong> When exposed to direct sunlight, a strigoi immediately becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious} and falls to the ground. It appears to be dead: it doesn't breathe, its body temperature matches its surroundings, and it doesn't react to pain or other stimuli. A successful @Check[perception|against:reflex] check against the strigoi's Reflex DC is enough to note one anomaly: the shadow cast by its \"dead\" body shifts and moves slightly, its edges twisting and active. Spells like @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.QnTtGCAvdWRU4spv]{Detect Alignment}, senses like lifesense, and the \"corpse\" taking damage from vitality energy still function normally, and could reveal the truth without needing a successful Perception check. Viewing the \"corpse\" in a mirror's reflection can also reveal the truth, for only the body's shadow reflects. While in sunlight and unconscious, the strigoi loses its resistance to physical damage. If the strigoi takes enough damage that it would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, its body quickly decomposes, and the strigoi is destroyed.</li>\n<li><strong>Water Revulsion</strong> A strigoi cannot cross a significant source of running water (such as a creek, river, or waves on a seashore). A strigoi capable of flight can cross running water provided it approaches no closer than 10 feet to the liquid's surface. If forced into running water against its will, the strigoi becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 2} and gains the fleeing condition as long as it remains in the water. At the end of any turn in which the strigoi remains in running water, it must succeed at a @Check[flat|dc:5] or be destroyed.</li>\n</ul>"

Occasionally, rich nobles will collect dinosaurs to display them in menageries, which almost inevitably leads to cast-offs being nursed back to health by druids and other champions of nature.

A fully grown tormonshild resembles a two-foot-long frog with six legs, a mouth too large for its body, and flesh the color of a storm cloud. Once grown, the tormonshild decimates the local wildlife, sometimes attacking creatures up to twice its size.

A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless they're transported while they hide within their coffin, nor can they enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions\u2014a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome their compulsion just as they do their revulsion.</li>\n<li><strong>Revulsion</strong> A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a deity with a holy sanctification option. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so, and it remains brandished for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they end an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of their revulsion, a vampire can attempt a @Check[will|dc:25] save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for [[/gmr 1d6 #rounds]]{1d6 rounds} (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li>\n<li><strong>Stake</strong> A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents them from healing above 0 HP, even in their coffin. Staking a vampire requires 3 actions and works only if the vampire is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious}.
