The veil of night, however, conceals a wide array of vampiric creatures. Neither wholly wolf nor bat, desmohunds, also called vampire hounds, use their limited flight to swiftly close the gap between themselves and fleeing prey. This rapid movement, along with a penchant for hunting in perfect darkness, is often the cause of a survivor's confusion when asked to describe just what it was that attacked them.</p>\n<p>As their common name suggests, vampire hounds share a strong affinity with vampires. While the hounds can subsist entirely on flesh, they have a particular taste for blood. A desmohund attack is brutal and violent. The creature tears their victim apart, allowing the blood to generously pool on the ground before lapping it up. Only after the blood is consumed do the beasts begin devouring flesh.</p>\n<p>Desmohunds are surprisingly loyal and often defend their masters to the death. Though they generally serve vampires, it isn't unheard of for the living to keep such creatures as pets, especially in areas like Ustalav, Nidal, and the Darklands, where they can sometimes be found prowling the grounds of foreboding estates.</p>\n<p>Vampire hunters carry a variety of tools to stalk and destroy their favored prey, but clever ones also carry items that can work against a vampire's allies too. Therefore, some carry bags of cinnamon or vials of eucalyptus oil to confuse and irritate desmohunds' keen sense of smell.</p><h2>Divine Origins</h2><p>Sources differ on the origin of desmohunds. Some legends state that Urgathoa created the first vampire hounds as pets to keep her company in undeath. Others claim that Nin distilled the best parts of vampires and wolves to create a nigh-unstoppable hunter. One story posits that Lamashtu created the first desmohunds, but Zura the Vampire Queen stole them from Lamashtu's realm of Kurnugia, claiming the creatures as her own. The only common thread among these tales is each god's insistence that they were the true creators of desmohunds, suggesting that there's an unknown reason the gods would vie for such a title.</p>",

A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless they're transported while they hide within their coffin, nor can they enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions\u2014a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome their compulsion just as they do their revulsion.</li>\n<li><strong>Revulsion</strong> A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a deity with a holy sanctification option. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so, and it remains brandished for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they end an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of their revulsion, a vampire can attempt a @Check[will|dc:25] save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for [[/gmr 1d6 #rounds]]{1d6 rounds} (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li>\n<li><strong>Stake</strong> A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents them from healing above 0 HP, even in their coffin. Staking a vampire requires 3 actions and works only if the vampire is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious}. If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if they're in their coffin, the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed.

The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends their turn in sunlight, and the condition ends when they're no longer in sunlight.
