It has grown from suggestions of the community and now it has more features.</p><ul><li><p><strong data-start=\"493\" data-end=\"507\">Important:</strong> The default “Quick Alchemy” action on character sheets remains unchanged. This module adds a separate @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-alchemist-remaster-ducttape.alchemist-duct-tape-macros.Macro.ZTOUwRh7BGixOtL9]{Macro} for Quick Alchemy functionality.. </p></li></ul><p></p><p>@UUID[.snwAOVnkbCHVr7YO]{Explaining Quick Alchemy, Versatile Vials, \"Quick Vials\", \"Field Vials\", etc.}</p><div class=\"markdown-heading\"><h3>Supported Features</h3></div><p>This module implements features using the following \"sub-modules\":</p><ul><li><p><strong>Quick Alchemy</strong> – Macro tool to craft infused alchemical items using versatile vials. Support for Double Brew feat and expanded functionality for Field Vials and Healing Bombs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Alchemist Feats</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx?ID=56\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Powerful Alchemy</strong></a> – Will monitor crafted infused items, and if relevant will update the item description, including inline checks to use the Alchemist Class DC for saves if the character has the Powerful Alchemy feat.</li><li><a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx?ID=56\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Double Brew</strong></a> – Quick Alchemy macro will prompt to make an additional item using Double Brew.</li><li><a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=5778\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Debilitating Bomb</strong></a> – The <a href=\"https://github.com/foundryvtt/pf2e\">PF2e system</a> now supports this, enable this feature on the actions tab of your character sheet.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/thejoester/pf2e-alchemist-remaster-ducttape/wiki/Healing-Bombs\"><strong>Healing Bombs</strong></a> – Healing bombs are now fully supported. When using a Quick Vial for a healing item, the module creates a ranged Strike with proper tags (Alchemical, Consumable, Healing, Splash). Includes support for Greater Field Discovery: Chirurgeon (Automatically applies maximum healing). Splash Healing support.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Vial Search</strong> – Will monitor game world time. When 10 minutes or more pass, it will prompt in chat to \"find\" versatile vials and add them to inventory. Supports Alchemical Expertise feat.</p></li><li><p><strong>Level Up</strong> – Monitors when an Alchemist levels up, and adds higher-level versions of known formulas. For example, if a character knows Elixir of Life (Minor), when they reach level 5 it adds Elixir of Life (Lesser) formula.</p><ul><li><p>There are two macros in the <strong>Alchemist Duct Tape Macros compendium</strong> that will allow you to run this check at any time.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Formula Search</strong> – Adds a search bar to the crafting tab for formulas to help filter and locate known recipes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Localization</strong> – All chat messages, settings, tooltips, and labels are localized. Currently supports English (en), Polish (pl), and Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR). Community translations are welcome!</p></li><li><p><strong>Homebrew Alchemical Support</strong> – The module now better supports custom homebrew alchemical items, including healing bombs and poison vials, as long as they use standard PF2E item flags and system fields.</p></li></ul>"

This is something I also struggled with when I started working on this module for one of my players, so I wanted to have this entry to reference.</p><hr /><div class=\"markdown-heading\"><h2 class=\"heading-element\">Quick Alchemy</h2></div><p>If you look at <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=2801\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quick Alchemy</a> (<em>Bold and underlining is mine, for emphasis</em>):</p><blockquote><p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Sources.aspx?ID=227\" rel=\"nofollow\">Player Core 2 pg. 59</a> <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Sources.aspx?ID=227\" rel=\"nofollow\">1.1</a></p><p><strong>Requirements</strong> You're either holding or wearing an <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2702\" rel=\"nofollow\">alchemist's toolkit</a> and you have a free hand</p><hr /><p>You can <strong><ins>either</ins></strong> use up a versatile vial to make another alchemical consumable at a moment's notice <strong><ins>or</ins></strong> create an especially short-lived versatile vial. Any effect created by an item made with Quick Alchemy that would have a duration longer than 10 minutes lasts for 10 minutes instead.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Create Consumable</strong> You expend one of your versatile vials to create a single alchemical consumable item of your level or lower that's in your formula book. You don't have to spend the normal monetary cost in alchemical raw materials or need to attempt a Crafting check. This item has the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=797\" rel=\"nofollow\">infused</a> trait, but it remains potent only until the start of your next turn. (As normal, you need only one formula for an item to create any level of that item.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Quick Vial</strong> You create a versatile vial that can be used only as a bomb or for the versatile vial option from your research field (it can't be used to create a consumable, for example). This item has the infused trait, but it remains potent only until the end of your current turn.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>I myself had some confusion around the wording on this but the consensus and guidance from Paizo was that the wording is pointing out that with Quick Alchemy you can:</p><p><em><strong>EITHER</strong></em></p><p>(A) perform the the \"Create Consumable\" action expending a Versatile vial to create an <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=797\" rel=\"nofollow\">infused</a> alchemical consumable (such as Alchemist's Fire, Acid Flask, or Elixir of Life)...</p><p><em><strong>OR</strong></em></p><p>(B) create a <em>new</em> <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=797\" rel=\"nofollow\">infused</a> versatile vial that can only be used as a versatile vial bomb or as a field vial from your research field.</p><p></p><div class=\"markdown-heading\"><h2 class=\"heading-element\">Redefined terms for clarity</h2></div><p>I think part of the confusion on how they worded this is reusing \"versatile vial\" for too many things. In my module for clarity in differentiating these similar items, I define them the following way:</p><ul><li><strong>Versatile Vial</strong> - The item that the alchemist makes during daily prep. Limited special items that can be used as bombs <em><strong>OR </strong></em>be turned into other alchemical items by introducing special reagents using Quick Alchemy.</li><li><strong>Quick Vial</strong> - The very temporary and limited version of a Versatile Vial that cannot make a consumable but can be used as a bomb or as a <strong>Field Vial</strong>.</li><li><strong>Field Vial</strong> - Special vials (either from Versatile Vials or Quick Vials) that an alchemist can make depending on their <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/ResearchFields.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Research Field</a>.</li></ul><p>Think of <strong>Quick Vials</strong> as the alchemist's version of a cantrip, you can make unlimited Quick Vials but they are not as powerful or long lasting.</p><p><strong>Field Vials</strong> are either a <strong>Versatile Vial</strong> or <strong>Quick Vial</strong> that is made with special properties depending on your <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/ResearchFields.aspx\">research field</a>. You <em>can </em>use a Versatile Vial for this, but this consumes a more limited resource when you have unlimited Quick Vials. </p>"
