If your zombie mount is nimble or savage, the bludgeoning damage increases to [[/r 2d4[bludgeoning]]]{2d4}. This benefit is based on a zombie horse or camel, but might deal piercing damage if your mount has sharp teeth.</p>",

Until the start of your next turn, each time you hit a creature that's within 10 feet of the zombie and you deal damage, the creature takes an additional [[/r 1d6]] damage as the wound festers. If your zombie is nimble or savage, the damage increases to [[/r 2d6]]. This is a disease and necromancy effect.</p>",
